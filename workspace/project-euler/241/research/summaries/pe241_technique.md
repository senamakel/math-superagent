# Project Euler 241 Solution - Perfection Quotients

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=241>:

* [241.py](241.py)

We need all `n <= 10^18` such that `sigma(n) / n` is a half-integer.  For this
bound the search is split across the targets

\[
\frac32,\frac52,\frac72,\frac92,\frac{11}2,\frac{13}2.
\]

For a fixed target `T`, the solver tracks the reduced residual quotient

\[
Q(n)=T\frac{n}{\sigma(n)}=\frac{u}{v}.
\]

The target is reached exactly when `Q(n) = 1`.  Extending a partial
factorization by `p^e` updates the residual by

\[
Q(np^e)=Q(n)\frac{p^e}{\sigma(p^e)}.
\]

The main pruning invariant is that any completion must have its remaining
cofactor divisible by the current denominator `v`.  Therefore the smallest
prime factor of `v` is forced as the next prime in the search.  If `p^a`
divides `v`, the exponent loop starts at `a`, because the numerator contribution
`p^e` must be large enough to cancel that denominator power.

Branches are discarded when:

* the residual quotient falls below `1`;
* the lower bound `n * v > 10^18` makes completion impossible;
* the denominator forces a prime that has already been used.

Denominators are factored with deterministic Miller-Rabin and Pollard-Rho, with
cached factorization results.  The six target searches produce the 22 valid
values below the limit, whose sum is printed.
