Prime Number Races

Andrew Granville and Greg Martin

1. INTRODUCTION. There’s nothing quite like a day at the races. . . . The quicken-
ing of the pulse as the starter’s pistol sounds, the thrill when your favorite contestant
speeds out into the lead (or the distress if another contestant dashes out ahead of yours),
and the accompanying fear (or hope) that the leader might change. And what if the race
is a marathon? Maybe one of the contestants will be far stronger than the others, taking
the lead and running at the head of the pack for the whole race. Or perhaps the race
will be more dramatic, with the lead changing again and again for as long as one cares
to watch.
Our race involves the odd prime numbers, separated into two teams depending on
the remainder when they are divided by 4:

Mod 4 Race, Team 3: 03, 07, 11, 19, 23, 31, 43, 47, 59, 67, 71, 79, 83, . . .

Mod 4 Race, Team 1: 05, 13, 17, 29, 37, 41, 53, 61, 73, 89, 93, 97, . . .

In this Mod 4 Race,1 Team 3 contains the primes of the form 4n + 3, and Team 1
contains the primes of the form 4n + 1. The Mod 4 Race has just two contestants and
is quite some marathon because it goes on forever! From the data just presented it
appears that Team 3 is always in the lead; that is, up to any given point, there seem to
be at least as many primes of the form 4n + 3 as there are primes of the form 4n + 1.
Further data seems to conﬁrm our initial observations:

1The integers in the arithmetic progression qn + a are often called the integers “congruent to a modulo q,”
and thus we have the “Mod q Races.”

January 2006] PRIME NUMBER RACES 1

Even in this extended data, the race remains close, but Team 3 always seems to
maintain a narrow lead. This phenomenon was ﬁrst observed in a letter written by
Tch«ebychev to M. Fuss on 23 March 1853:

There is a notable difference in the splitting of the prime numbers between the two forms
4n + 3, 4n + 1: the ﬁrst form contains a lot more than the second.

This bias is perhaps unexpected in light of an important result in analytic number the-
ory known as “the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions.” This theorem
tells us that the primes tend to be equally split amongst the various forms qn + a with
gcd(a, q) = 1 for any given modulus q.
2 More precisely, we know that for two such
eligible values a and b,

#{primes qn + a ≤ x}
#{primes qn + b ≤ x} → 1 (as x → ∞). (1)

This limit does not help us to predict who will win the Mod q Race.3 In fact this
asymptotic result, the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions, does not
inform us about any of the ﬁne details of these prime number counts, so neither veriﬁes
nor contradicts our observation that Team 3 seems to be always ahead of Team 1.
It’s time to come clean: we cheated in how we presented the data in Table 1. If we
take the trouble to look at the counts of Teams 1 and 3 for every value of x, not just
the ones listed in the table, we ﬁnd that occasionally there is some drama to this race,
in that from time to time Team 1 takes the lead, but then only brieﬂy.
Team 1 takes the lead for the ﬁrst time at prime 26,861. However, since 26,863
is also prime, Team 3 draws even and then takes back the lead until Team 1 bolts
ahead again at 616,841 and at various numbers until 633,798. Team 3 then regains
the lead until Team 1 surges ahead again at 12,306,137 and at various numbers up
to 12,382,326. Team 3 then takes back the lead until Team 1 gets ahead again at
951,784,481 and at various numbers until 952,223,506. Team 3 then retakes the
lead until Team 1 seizes it back at 6,309,280,697 and at various numbers below
6,403,150,362. Team 3 then grabs the lead until Team 1 charges to the front at
18,465,126,217 and at various numbers until 19,033,524,538. Team 3 then reassumes
the lead and holds on to it until at least twenty billion.
So there are, from time to time, more primes of the form 4n + 1 than of the form
4n + 3, but this lead is held only very brieﬂy and then relinquished for a long stretch.
Nonetheless, given this data, one might guess that 4n + 1 will occasionally take the
lead as we continue to watch this marathon. Indeed this is the case, as Littlewood
discovered in 1914 [18]:

Theorem (J.E. Littlewood, 1914). There are arbitrarily large values of x for which
there are more primes of the form 4n + 1 up to x than primes of the form 4n + 3. In
fact, there are arbitrarily large values of x for which

#{primes 4n + 1 ≤ x} − #{primes 4n + 3 ≤ x} ≥ 1
2
 √x
ln x ln ln ln x. (2)

2Note that this restriction is necessary, since every integer of the form qn + a is divisible by the greatest
common divisor of a and q, hence cannot be prime (except possibly for a single value n) if gcd(a, q) > 1.
3If the ratio #{primes 4n + 3 ≤ x}/#{primes 4n + 1 ≤ x} converged to a number greater than 1 as x → ∞,
then we would know that #{primes 4n + 3 ≤ x} > #{primes 4n + 1 ≤ x} for all sufﬁciently large x, so that in
the long run Team 3 would always be ahead of Team 1. If it converged to a number less than 1 then, in the long
run, Team 1 would always be ahead of Team 3.

At ﬁrst sight, this seems to be the end of the story. However, after seeing how
infrequently Team 1 manages to hold on to the lead, it is hard to put to rest the suspicion
that Team 3 is in the lead “most of the time,” that usually there are more primes of the
form 4n + 3 up to x than there are of the form 4n + 1, despite Littlewood’s result.
In 1962, Knapowski and Tur«an made a conjecture that is consistent with Littlewood’s
result but also bears out Tch«ebychev’s observation:

Conjecture. As X → ∞, the percentage of integers x ≤ X for which there are more
primes of the form 4n + 3 up to x than of the form 4n + 1 goes to 100%.

This conjecture may be paraphrased as “Tch«ebychev was correct almost all of the
time.” Let’s reconsider our data in terms of this conjecture by giving, for X in various
ranges, the maximum percentage of values of x ≤ X for which there are more primes
of type 4n + 1 with 4n + 1 ≤ x than of type 4n + 3:

For X in Maximum percentage
the range of such x ≤ X

0—26,860 0%
0—500,000 0.01%
0—10
7 2.6%

8 .6%
10
8—10
9 .1%
10
9—10
10 1.6%
10
10—10
11 2.8%

Does this persuade you that the Knapowski-Tur«an conjecture is likely to be true?
Is the percentage in the right column going to 0 as the values of x get larger? The
percentages are evidently very low, but it is not obvious from this limited data that they
are tending towards 0. There was a wonderful article in this MONTHLY by Richard Guy
some years ago, entitled “The Law of Small Numbers” [11], in which Guy pointed out
several fascinating phenomena that are “evident” for small integers yet disappear when
one examines bigger integers. Could this be one of those phenomena?

Another prime race: primes of the form 3n + 2 and 3n + 1. There are races be-
tween sequences of primes other than that between primes of the forms 4n + 3 and
4n + 1. For example, the Mod 3 Race is between primes of the form 3n + 2 and primes
of the form 3n + 1. The race begins as follows:

Mod 3 Race, Team 2: 02, 05, 11, 17, 23, 29, 41, 47, 53, 59, 71, 83, 89, . . .

Mod 3 Race, Team 1: 07, 13, 19, 31, 37, 43, 61, 67, 73, 79, 97, . . .

In this race Team 2 dashes out to an early lead that it holds on to; that is, there seems
always to be at least as many primes of the form 3n + 2 up to x as there are primes
of the form 3n + 1. In fact Team 2 stays in the lead up to ten million and beyond (see
Table 2).

4And this time we didn’t cheat—Team 1 does not get the lead at some intermediate value of x that we have
not recorded in the table.

Perhaps our experience with the Mod 4 Race makes you skeptical that Team 2
always dominates in this Mod 3 Race. If so, you are right to be skeptical because Lit-
tlewood’s 1914 paper also applies to this race: there are arbitrarily large values of x for
which there are more primes of the form 3n + 1 up to x than primes of the form 3n + 2.
(An inequality analogous to (2) also holds for this race.) Therefore Team 1 takes the
lead from Team 2 inﬁnitely often, but where is the ﬁrst such value for x? We know it
is beyond ten million, and in fact Team 1 ﬁrst takes the lead at x = 608,981,813,029.
This was discovered on Christmas Day of 1976 by Bays and Hudson. It seems that
Team 2 dominates in the Mod 3 Race even more than Team 3 dominates in the Mod
4 Race!

Another prime race: the last digit of a prime. Having heard that “Team 2 retains
the lead . . . ” for over a half-a-trillion consecutive values of x, you might have grown
bored with your day at the races. So let’s move on to a race in which there are more
competitors, perhaps making it less likely that one will so dominate. One popular four-
way race is between the primes that end in 1, those that end in 3, those that end in 7,
and those that end in 9 (Table 3).

Table 3. The columns labeled “Last digit j” contain the primes of the form 10n + j up to 100 and between
100 and 200, respectively.

On this limited evidence it seems that the two teams in the middle lanes are usually
ahead. However, let us examine the data in Table 4 before making any bets:

Table 4. The column labeled “Last digit j” contains the number of primes of the form 10n + j up to x.

1,000,000 19617 19665 19621 19593

Except for a brief surge by Team 1 ahead of Team 3 around x = 500,000, it does
appear that the two teams in the middle lanes continue to share the lead.
After watching these races for a while, we begin to get the sense that each race
is somewhat predictable—not the tiny details, perhaps, but the large-scale picture. If
we were to watch a similar race (the Mod q Race for some number q other than 4
or 3 or 10), we might expect that some of the teams would be much stronger overall
than others. But how could we predict which ones, without watching for so long that
everybody around us would already be placing their bets on those same teams?
Before we can hope to understand which team has the most primes most often, we
need to appreciate how those prime counts behave in the ﬁrst place. And before we
can hope to understand the number of primes up to x of the form qn + a (for given
a and q), we should start by knowing how many primes there are up to x. This was
perhaps the single most important question in nineteenth-century number theory, a
question that continued to engage researchers throughout the twentieth century and is
still jealously guarding most of its secrets from us today.

2. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE COUNT OF PRIMES UP TO x?
Although questions in number theory were not always mathematically en vogue,
by the middle of the nineteenth century the problem of counting primes had at-
tracted the attention of well-respected mathematicians such as Legendre, Tch«ebychev,
and the prodigious Gauss. Although the best rigorous results of this time were due to
Tch«ebychev, the prediction of Gauss eventually led to a better understanding of prime
number races.
A query about the frequency with which primes occur elicited the following re-
sponse:

I pondered this problem as a boy, and determined that, at around x, the primes occur with
density 1/ ln x.—C. F. Gauss (letter to Encke, 24 December 1849)

This remark of Gauss can be interpreted as predicting that

#{primes ≤ x} ≈
 [x]∑

n=2
 1
ln n ≈ ∫ x

2
 dt
ln t = Li(x).

Table 5 compares Gauss’s prediction
5 with the most recent count of the number of
primes up to x. (We write “Overcount” to denote Li(x) − π(x) rounded down to the
nearest integer, which is the difference between Gauss’s prediction Li(x) and the func-
tion π(x), the true number of primes up to x.)

We can make several observations from these overcounts. First notice that the width
of the last column is always approximately half the width of the middle column. In
other words, the overcount seems to be about the square root of the main term π(x)
itself. Also the error term seems always to be positive, so we might guess that

0 < Li(x) − π(x) < √π(x)

for all x. In fact the overcount appears to be monotonically increasing, which suggests
that we might be able to better approximate π(x) by subtracting some smooth sec-
ondary term from the approximating function Li(x), a question we shall return to later.
But, for now, let’s get back to the races. . . .
The function Li(x) does not count primes, but it does seem to stay close to π(x),
always remaining just in the lead. So for the race between Li(x) and π(x), we can ask:
Will Li(x) retain the lead forever? Littlewood’s amazing result [18] applies here too:

Theorem (Littlewood). There are arbitrarily large values of x for which π(x) >
Li(x), that is, for which
 #{primes ≤ x} > ∫ x

2
 dt
ln t .

So what is the smallest x1 for which π(x1) > Li(x1)? Skewes obtained an upper
bound for x1 from Littlewood’s proof, though not a particularly accessible bound.
Skewes proved in 1933 that
 x1 < 10
10101034 ,

5In fact, Legendre made a similar though less accurate “prediction” some years before Gauss.

6 c⃝ THE MATHEMATICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA [Monthly 113

and to do even this he needed to make a signiﬁcant assumption. Skewes assumed the
truth of the “Riemann Hypothesis,” a conjecture that we shall discuss a little later. For
a long time, this “Skewes’ number” was known as the largest number to which any
“interesting” mathematical meaning could be ascribed. Skewes later gave an upper
bound that did not depend on any unproved assumption, though at the cost of making
the numerical estimate marginally more monstrous, and several improvements have
been made since then:
 Skewes (1955): x1 < 10
1010101000

Lehman (1966): x1 < 2 × 10
1165

te Riele (1987): x1 < 6.658 × 10
370

Bays and Hudson (1999): x1 < 1.3982 × 10
316

As we shall discuss later, Bays and Hudson give compelling reasons to believe that x1
is actually some integer close to 1.3982 × 10
316. This is an extraordinary claim! We
can only compute prime counts up to around x = 10
22 with our current technology
and algorithms, and no signiﬁcant improvements to this are foreseen. So how can they
make such a prediction of the enormous value of x1, when this prediction is so far
beyond the point where we can ever hope to compute π(x) directly?
We shall explain this later. One thought though: if the ﬁrst number x for which π(x)
pulls ahead of Li(x) is so large, then surely the numbers x for which π(x) > Li(x) are
even scarcer than the corresponding “underdog” numbers in the races we examined
earlier!

Accurately estimating the count of primes. Up to the middle of the nineteenth cen-
tury, every approach to estimating π(x) = #{primes ≤ x} was relatively direct, based
either upon elementary number theory and combinatorial principles or upon the the-
ory of quadratic forms. In 1859, however, the great geometer Riemann took up the
challenge of counting the primes in a very different way. He wrote only one paper that
could be classiﬁed under the heading “number theory,” but that one short memoir has
had an impact lasting nearly a century and a half already, and its ideas helped to deﬁne
the subject we now call analytic number theory.
Riemann’s memoir described a surprising approach to the problem, an approach us-
ing the theory of complex analysis, which was at that time still very much a developing
subject.
6 This new approach of Riemann seemed to stray far away from the realm in
which the original problem lived. However, it had two key features:

• it was a potentially practical way to settle the question once and for all;

• it made predictions that were similar, though not identical, to the Gauss prediction.

In fact, as we shall see, it suggested a secondary term to compensate somewhat for the
overcount we saw in the data in Table 5.
Riemann’s method is too complicated to describe in its entirety here, but we extract
from it what we need to better understand the prime count π(x). To begin, we take the
key prediction from Riemann’s memoir and restate it in entirely elementary language:

lcm[1, 2, 3, . . . , x] ≈ ex (as x → ∞).

6Indeed, Riemann’s memoir on this number-theoretic problem was a signiﬁcant factor in the development
of the theory of analytic functions, notably their global aspects.

Notice that the primes in the ﬁrst sum are precisely the primes counted by π(x),
the primes in the second sum are precisely the primes counted by π(√x), and so on.
A technique called partial summation allows us to “take care of” the ln p summand
(which is analogous to using integration by parts to take care of a ln x factor in an
integrand). When partial summation is applied to the last approximation, the result is

π(x) + 1

If we “solve for π(x)” in an appropriate way, we ﬁnd the equivalent form

Hence Riemann’s method yields the same prediction as Gauss’s, yet it yields some-
thing extra—namely, it predicts a secondary term that will hopefully compensate for
the overcount that we witnessed in the Gauss prediction. Let’s review the data and see
how Riemann’s prediction fares. “Riemann’s overcount” refers to Li(x) − 1
2 Li(√x) −
π(x), while “Gauss’s overcount” refers to Li(x) − π(x) as before (Table 6):

Riemann’s prediction does seem to be a little better than that of Gauss, although not
a lot better. However, the fact that the error in Riemann’s prediction takes both positive
and negative values suggests that this might be about the best we can do.
Going back to the key prediction from Riemann’s memoir, we can calculate some
data to test its accuracy:
 Nearest integer to
x ln(lcm[1, 2, 3, . . . , x]) Difference

100 94 −6
1000 997 −3
10000 10013 13
100000 100052 57
1000000 999587 −413

Riemann’s prediction has been made more precise over the years, and it can now be
expressed very explicitly as

| ln(lcm[1, 2, . . . , x]) − x| ≤ 2
√x ln
2 x

when x ≥ 100. In fact, this inequality is equivalent7 to the celebrated Riemann Hy-
pothesis, perhaps the most prominent open problem in mathematics. The Riemann
Hypothesis is an assertion, proposed by Riemann in his memoir and still unproved,
about the zeros of a certain function from complex analysis that is intimately con-
nected with the distribution of primes. To try to give some idea of what Riemann did
to connect the two seemingly unrelated areas of number theory and complex analysis,
we need to talk about writing functions as combinations of “waves.”

Doing the wave. You have probably wondered what “radio waves” and “sound
waves” have to do with waves. Sounds don’t usually seem to be very “wavy,” but
rather are fractured, broken up, stopping and starting and changing abruptly. So what’s
the connection? The idea is that all sounds can be converted into a sum of waves. For
example, let’s imagine that our “sound” is represented by the gradually ascending line
y = x − 1
2 , considered on the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, which is shown in the ﬁrst graph of
Figure 1.

If we try to approximate this with a “wave,” we can come pretty close in the middle
of the line using the function y = − 1
π sin(2π x). However, as we see in the second
graph of Figure 1, the approximation is rather poor when x < 1/4 or x > 3/4.

7As is |Li(x) − π(x)| ≤ √x ln x when x ≥ 3.

How can we improve this approximation? The idea is to “add” a second wave to the
ﬁrst, this second wave going through two complete cycles over the interval [0, 1] rather
than only one cycle. This corresponds to hearing the sound of the two waves at the
same time, superimposed; mathematically, we literally add the two functions together.
As it turns out, adding the function y = − 1
2π sin(4π x) makes the approximation better
for a range of x-values that is quite a bit larger than the range of good approximation
we obtained with one wave, as we see in Figure 2.

We can continue in this way, adding more and more waves that go through three,
four, or ﬁve complete cycles in the interval, and so on, to get increasingly better ap-
proximations to the original straight line. The approximation we get by using one
hundred superimposed waves is really quite good, except near the endpoints 0 and 1.

Figure 3. The sum of one hundred carefully chosen waves.

If we were to watch these one hundred approximations being built up one addi-
tional wave at a time, we would quickly be willing to wager that the more waves we
allowed ourselves, the better the resulting approximation would be, perhaps becoming
as accurate as could ever be hoped for. As long as we allow a tiny bit of error in the
approximation (and shut our eyes to what happens very near the endpoints), we can in
fact construct a sufﬁciently close approximation if we use enough waves. However, to
get a “perfect” copy of the original straight-line, we would need to use inﬁnitely many
sine waves—more precisely, the ones on the right-hand side of the formula

x − 1
2 = −2
 ∞∑

n=1
 sin(2πnx)
2πn ,

which can be shown to hold whenever 0 < x < 1. (We can read off, in the n = 1
and n = 2 terms of this sum, the two waves that we chose for Figures 1 and 2.) This
formula is not of much practical use, since we can’t really transmit inﬁnitely many
waves at once—but it’s a gorgeous formula nonetheless!

10 c⃝ THE MATHEMATICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA [Monthly 113

In general, for any function f (x) deﬁned on the interval [0, 1] that is not “too ir-
regular,” we can ﬁnd numbers an and bn such that f (x) can be written as a sum of
trigonometric functions, namely,

f (x) = a0 +
 ∞∑

n=1(an cos(2πnx) + bn sin(2πnx)).

This formula, together with a way to calculate the coefﬁcients an and bn, is one of
the key identities from “Fourier analysis,” and it and its many generalizations are the
subject of the ﬁeld of mathematics known as harmonic analysis. In terms of waves,
the numbers 2πn are the “frequencies” of the various component waves (controlling
how fast they go through their cycles), while the coefﬁcients an and bn are their “am-
plitudes” (controlling how far up and down they go).

Riemann’s revolutionary formula. Riemann’s idea can be simply, albeit rather sur-
prisingly, phrased in the following terms:

Try counting the primes as a sum of waves.

The precise formula he proposed is a bit too technical for this article, but we can get
a good sense of it from the following approximation when x is large. This formula,
while widely believed to be correct, has not yet been proved to be true.

√x/ ln x ≈ 1 + 2 ∑

all real numbers γ > 0
such that 1
2 + iγ
is a zero of ζ(s)
 sin(γ ln x)
γ . (3)

The numerator of the left-hand side of this formula is the error term when comparing
the Gauss prediction Li(x) with the actual count π(x) for the number of primes up
to x. We saw earlier that the overcounts seemed to be roughly the size of the square
root of x, so the denominator √x/ ln x appears to be an appropriate thing to divide
through by. The right side of the formula bears much in common with our formula for
x − 1/2. It is a sum of sine functions, with the numbers γ employed in two different
ways in place of 2πn: each γ is used inside the sine (as the “frequency”), and the
reciprocal of each γ forms the coefﬁcient of the sine (as the “amplitude”). We even
get the same factor of 2 in each formula. However, the numbers γ here are much
more subtle than the straightforward numbers 2πn in the corresponding formula for
x − 1/2.
The Riemann zeta-function ζ (s) is deﬁned as

ζ (s) = 1
1s + 1
2s + 1
3s + · · · .

Here s is a complex number, which we write as s = σ + it when we want to refer to
its real and imaginary parts σ and t separately. If s were a real number, we would know
from ﬁrst-year calculus that the series in the deﬁnition of ζ (s) converges if and only
if s > 1; that is, we can sum up the inﬁnite series and obtain a ﬁnite, unique value. In
a similar way, it can be shown that the series only converges for complex numbers s
such that σ > 1. But what about when σ ≤ 1? How do we get around the fact that the
series does not sum up (that is, converge)?

January 2006] PRIME NUMBER RACES 11

Fortunately, there is a beautiful phenomenon in the theory of functions of a com-
plex variable called analytic continuation. It tells us that functions that are originally
deﬁned only for certain complex numbers often have unique “sensible” deﬁnitions for
other complex numbers. In this case, the deﬁnition of ζ (s) as presented works only
when σ > 1, but it turns out that analytic continuation allows us to deﬁne ζ (s) for
every complex number s other than s = 1 (see [26] for details).
This description of the process of analytic continuation looks disconcertingly mag-
ical. Fortunately, there is a quite explicit way to show how ζ (σ + it) can be “sensibly”
deﬁned at least for the region where σ > 0, an extension of the region (σ > 1) where
ζ (s) is originally deﬁned. For this, we start with the expression (1 − 2
1−s)ζ (s) and
perform some sleight-of-hand manipulations:

(1 − 2
1−s)ζ (s) = (1 − 2
2s

Solving for ζ (s), we ﬁnd that

ζ (s) = 1
(1 − 21−s)
 {( 1

2s
 ) + ( 1
3s − 1
4s
 ) + ( 1

 ) + · · · } .

All of these manipulations were valid for complex numbers s = σ + it with σ > 1.
However, it turns out that the inﬁnite series in curly brackets actually converges when-
ever σ > 0. Therefore, we can take this last equation as the new “sensible” deﬁnition
of the Riemann zeta-function on this larger domain. Note that the special number s = 1
causes the otherwise innocuous factor of 1/(1 − 2
1−s) to be undeﬁned; the Riemann
zeta-function intrinsically has a problem there, one that cannot be swept away with
clever rearrangements of the inﬁnite series.
Riemann’s formula (3) depends on the zeros of the analytic continuation of ζ (s).
The easiest zeros to identify are the negative even integers; that is

ζ (−2) = 0, ζ (−4) = 0, ζ (−6) = 0, . . . ,

which are called the “trivial zeros” of the zeta-function. It can be shown that any other
complex zero σ + it of the zeta-function (that is, a number satisfying ζ (σ + it) = 0)
must satisfy 0 ≤ σ ≤ 1; these more mysterious zeros of the zeta-function are called its
“nontrivial zeros.”
After some calculation,8 Riemann observed that all of the nontrivial zeros of the
zeta-function seem to lie on the line with equation Re(s) = 1/2. In other words, he

8No reference to these calculations of Riemann appeared in the literature until Siegel discovered them in
Riemann’s personal, unpublished notes long after Riemann’s death.

12 c⃝ THE MATHEMATICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA [Monthly 113

stated the remarkable hypothesis:

If σ + it is a complex number with 0 ≤ σ ≤ 1 and ζ (σ + it) = 0, then σ = 1
2 .

This assertion, which nobody has yet managed to prove, is the famous “Riemann Hy-
pothesis.”
If the Riemann Hypothesis is in fact true, then we can write all the nontrivial zeros of
the zeta-function in the form ρ = 1
2 + iγ (together with their conjugates 1
2 − iγ , since
ζ ( 1
2 + iγ ) = 0 if and only if ζ ( 1
2 − iγ ) = 0), where γ is a positive real number. These
are the mysterious numbers γ appearing in the formula (3), which holds if and only if
the Riemann Hypothesis is true. There is a similar formula if the Riemann Hypothesis
is false, but it is rather complicated and technically far less pleasant. The reason is that
the coefﬁcients 1/γ , which are constants in (3), get replaced with functions of x. So we
want the Riemann Hypothesis to hold because it leads to the simpler formula (3), and
that formula is a delight. Indeed (3) is similar enough to the formulas for soundwaves
for some experts to muse that (3) asserts that “the primes have music in them.”
One might ask how we add up the inﬁnite sum in (3)? Simple: add up by order of
ascending γ values and it will work out.
Clever people have computed literally billions of zeros of ζ (s), and every single
zero that has been computed does indeed satisfy σ = 1/2. For example, the nontrivial
zeros closest to the real axis are s = 1
2 + iγ1 and s = 1
2 − iγ1, where γ1 ≈ 14.1347 . . . .
We believe that the positive numbers γ occurring in the nontrivial zeros look more or
less like random real numbers, in the sense that none of them is related to others by
simple linear equations with integer coefﬁcients (or even by more complicated poly-
nomial equations with algebraic numbers as coefﬁcients). However, since about all
we know how to do is to approximate these nontrivial zeros numerically to a given
accuracy, we cannot say much about the precise nature of the numbers γ .

Prime race for π(x) versus Li(x). So, how do we use this variant on “Fourier analy-
sis” to locate the smallest x for which

#{primes ≤ x} > ∫ x

ln t ?

The idea is to approximate

Li(x) − π(x)
√x/ ln x =
 ∫ x
2 dt
ln t − #{primes ≤ x}
√x/ ln x

by using the formula (3). Just as we saw when approximating the function x − 1/2,
we expect to obtain a good approximation here simply by summing the formula on
the right side of (3) over the ﬁrst few zeros of ζ (s) (that is, the smallest hundred, or
thousand, or million values of γ with ζ ( 1
2 + iγ ) = 0, depending upon the level of
accuracy that we want). In other words,

The Mod 4 Race. In 1959, Shanks suggested studying the Mod 4 Race by drawing a
histogram of the values of

#{primes 4n + 3 ≤ x} − #{primes 4n + 1 ≤ x}
√x/ ln x . (4)

Figure 5. A histogram for the values of (4) at x = 1000k (1 ≤ k ≤ 1000).

This histogram is suggestive: one might guess that if we incorporate more and more
sample values, then the histogram will more and more resemble something like a bell-
shaped curve centered at 1. Littlewood’s result (2) implies that the tail does stretch out
horizontally to ∞ as more and more sample values are used, since the ratio in equation
(4) will be at least as large as some constant multiple of ln ln ln x for inﬁnitely many
values of x.
10 The inﬁnite extent of the histogram is certainly not evident from ﬁgure
5, but this is not so surprising since, as Dan Shanks remarked in 1959 [24]:

ln ln ln x goes to inﬁnity with great dignity.

In (3) we saw how the difference between π(x) and Li(x) can be approximated by a
sum of waves whose frequencies and amplitudes depend on the zeros of the Riemann
zeta-function. To count primes up to x of the form 4n + 1, or of the form 4n + 3, or of
any form qn + a with gcd(a, q) = 1, there is a formula analogous to (3) that depends
on the zeros of Dirichlet L-functions, relatives of the Riemann zeta-function that also
have natural though slightly more complicated deﬁnitions. For example, the Dirichlet
L-function associated with the race between primes of the form 4n + 3 and primes of
the form 4n + 1 is
 L(s) = 1
1s − 1
3s + 1
5s − 1
7s + . . . .

Note that this (and all other Dirichlet L-functions) converges for any s = σ + it with
σ > 0. There is a lovely formula, analogous to (3), for the number of primes of the

10In fact, Littlewood also proved the inequality with the two terms on the left-hand side reversed, so that the
histogram stretches out to −∞ as well.

January 2006] PRIME NUMBER RACES 15

form qn + a up to x. This formula holds if and only if all of the zeros of these Dirichlet
L-functions in the strip described by 0 ≤ Re(s) ≤ 1 satisfy Re(s) = 1/2. We call
this assertion the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. For example, if the Generalized
Riemann Hypothesis is true for the function L(s) just deﬁned, then we get the formula

#{primes 4n + 3 ≤ x} − #{primes 4n + 1 ≤ x}
√x/ ln x ≈ 1 + 2 ∑

Real numbers γ > 0
such that 1
2 + iγ
is a zero of L(s)

Consequently, we can try to study the Mod 4 Race by computing the right-hand side
of this formula, truncating to involve only a hundred or a thousand or a million zeros
of L(s). Figure 6 shows how well such an approximation with 1000 zeros agrees with
the actual data.

The ﬁrst three occasions that Team 1 takes the lead are clearly visible in both
graphs (earlier we presented the exact values for which this happens). The conve-
nient thing about the approximation is that the approximation doesn’t become hope-
lessly more difﬁcult to compute as x becomes large, unlike determining the precise
count of primes. In 1999 Bays and Hudson used such approximations to predict fur-
ther “sign changes” in (4) for x up to 10
1000. The next two that they predicted were
at approximately 1.4898 × 10
12, which was later found at 1,488,478,427,089, and at
approximately 9.3190 × 10

3. WHERE DO THESE BIASES COME FROM? We have observed several ex-
amples of prime number races and of biases that certain arithmetic progressions seem
to have over others. Although we have seen that such bias can be calculated through
complicated formulas like (3), this explanation is not easily understood, nor does it
give us a feeling as to how we might predict, without an enormous computation, which

16 c⃝ THE MATHEMATICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA [Monthly 113

of two progressions typically dominates the other. Let’s summarize the prime races we
have seen so far and look for a pattern, hoping that we can ﬁnd some short cut to
making such predictions. We have seen that there seem to be, at least most of the time,

• more primes of the form 4n + 3 than of the form 4n + 1;

• more primes of the form 3n + 2 than of the form 3n + 1; and

• more primes of the forms 10n + 3 and 10n + 7 than of the forms 10n + 1 and
10n + 9.

Do you see a pattern? There’s probably not enough data here to make a good guess.
But let’s check out one more four-way prime number race, this one with the forms
8n + 1, 8n + 3, 8n + 5, and 8n + 7 as the contestants (Table 7):

Table 7. The number of primes of the form 8n + j for j = 1, 3, 5, and 7 up to various x.

5,000 161 168 168 171

1,000,000 19,552 19,653 19,623 19,669

This is a strange race, since the only clear pattern that emerges is that there seem to be

• more primes of the forms 8n + 3, 8n + 5, and 8n + 7 than of the form 8n + 1.

In fact, this is true for all x between 23 and 10
6. But this “strangeness” should help
students of number theory guess at a pattern, because such students know that all odd
squares are of the form 8n + 1.
11

During our discussion about lcm[1, 2, . . . , n] and its connection with the prime
number counting function π(x), we saw that Riemann’s prediction π(x) + 1
2 #{primes p
with p2 ≤ x} is what is best approximated by ∫ x
2 dt/ ln t. In other words, it is the
squares of primes that “account” for the bias that Li(x) has over π(x) for most of the
time.
These pieces of evidence
12 point to the squares of primes playing an important role
in such biases. Let’s check out the arithmetic progressions that the squares of primes
belong to for the moduli already discussed in this section:

For any prime p not dividing 4, p2 is of the form 4n + 1.

For any prime p not dividing 3, p2 is of the form 3n + 1.

For any prime p not dividing 10, p2 is of the form 10n + 1 or 9.

For any prime p not dividing 8, p2 is of the form 8n + 1.

11Note that (2m − 1)2 = 8
(m
2 ) + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 8) for all odd integers 2m − 1.
12Admittedly somewhat circumstantial evidence.

January 2006] PRIME NUMBER RACES 17

Exactly right every time! It does seem that “typically” qn + a has fewer primes than
qn + b if a is a square modulo q while b is not.

What is the phenomenon that we are actually observing? We have been observing
some phenomena where there is a “typical” bias in favor of one arithmetic progression
over another, that is, one “usual” leader in the prime number race. So far, though, we
have not exhibited a precise description of this bias nor deﬁned a number that measures
how strong the bias is. In an earlier section, we stated Knapowski and Tur«an’s 1962
conjecture: if we pick a very large number x “at random,” then “almost certainly”
there will be more primes of the form 4n + 3 up to x than there are primes of the
form 4n + 1 up to x. (Obviously, such a conjecture can be generalized to the other
prime races we considered.) However, the supporting evidence from our data was not
entirely convincing. Indeed, by studying the explicit formula (3), Kaczorowski [14]
and Sarnak [22], independently, showed that the Knapowski-Tur«an conjecture is false!
In fact, the quantity

1
X #{x ≤ X : there are more primes of the form 4n + 3 up to x than of the form 4n + 1}

does not tend to any limit as X → ∞, but instead ﬂuctuates. This is not a very satisfy-
ing state of affairs, though it is feasible that we can’t really say anything more: it could
be that the phenomena we have observed are only true for “small numbers,”13 and that
the race looks truly “unbiased” when we go out far enough.
However, this turns out not to be the case. In 1994, Rubinstein and Sarnak made
an inspired observation. After determining that one progression does not dominate the
other for any ﬁxed percentage of the time, so that that precise line of thinking seemed
closed, Rubinstein and Sarnak said to themselves that perhaps the obvious way to count
prime number races is not necessarily the correct way to count them, at least in this
context. They observed that if you count things a little differently (in technical terms,
“if you use a different measure”), then you get a much more satisfactory answer. More-
over, you get a whole panorama of results that explain all the observed phenomena in
a way that feels very natural.
Sometimes in mathematics it is the simplest remark that is the key to unlocking a
mystery, not the hard technical slog, and that was certainly the case for this question.
The key idea of Rubinstein and Sarnak is not to count 1 for each integer x(≤ X ) for
which there are more primes of the form 4n + 3 up to x than of the form 4n + 1, but
rather to count 1/x. Of course, the total sum ∑
x≤X 1/x is not X , but approximately
ln X , so we need to scale with this instead. However, when we do so, we obtain a
remarkable result [21]:

In other words, with the appropriate method of measuring, Tch«ebychev was correct
99.59% of the time!
Moreover, their idea applies to all of the other prime number races that we have
been discussing. For example, in the Mod 3 Race, we have

as X → ∞, so Team 1 has only about one chance in a thousand of being ahead of
Team 3 at any given time, when we measure “being ahead” this way.
And what about the race between π(x) and Li(x)? Remember that we don’t expect
to ﬁnd a counterexample until we get out to the huge value x ≈ 1.3982 × 10
316. In this
case, Rubinstein and Sarnak showed that

as X → ∞. That is, with the appropriate method of measuring, π(x) < Li(x) about
99.999973% of the time! No wonder that the ﬁrst point at which π(x) > Li(x) is so
far out.
This successful way of measuring things is called the logarithmic measure (because
of the “normalizing factor” ln X ). It appears in many contexts in mathematics and was
even used in a related context by Wintner in 1941, but never quite in such an appealing
and transparent way as by Rubinstein and Sarnak.
Their wonderful results are proved under highly plausible assumptions. They as-
sume ﬁrst that the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis holds (in other words, marvellous
formulas analogous to (3) can be used to count primes of the form qn + a up to x), and
second that the γ s that arise in these formulas—the imaginary parts of the zeros of the
associated Dirichlet L-functions—are actually linearly independent over the rational
numbers. It would be shocking if either of these assumptions were false, but it does
seem unlikely that either one will be proved in the near future.

How do you prove such results? The proofs of the results that we have already men-
tioned, as well as those discussed in the next sections, are too technical to describe in
full detail here. However, they do all depend on careful examination of the formula (3)
and its analogues for the Mod q Races. The assumption of the Generalized Riemann
Hypothesis ensures, in all the cases under consideration, that a formula of the type (3)
exists in the ﬁrst place. To analyze its value, we need to consider the sum on the right
side of (3) and, in particular, the values of the various terms and how they interact:
each term −2 sin(γ ln x)/γ is a sine-wave that undulates regularly between −2/γ and
2/γ .
14 As we have seen when studying how such waves can combine to give approxi-
mations to a straight line, if the various values of γ can be chosen so that somehow the
individual undulations can be synchronized, then the sum can accumulate into surpris-
ing shapes. This leads to the second assumption: if we assume that the waves cannot
combine in some extraordinary way, then the sum should remain small and unsurpris-
ing. In other words, we would expect that a fair portion of the terms would be positive
and a fair portion would be negative, so there would be signiﬁcant cancellation. This
is what is achieved by assuming that the γ s are linearly independent over the rational
numbers. Under this second assumption, the values of the sin(γ ln x)-terms cannot be
well synchronized for very many values of x, and we are able to establish results. In
fact, we ﬁnd that the smallest few γ s have the largest inﬂuence on the value of the sum

14“Regularly,” that is, if we consider ln x to be the variable rather than x. In fact, this is really the reason that
the “logarithmic measure” is most appropriate for our prime number counts.

(which is not surprising, since the term corresponding to γ has a factor of γ in the
denominator).
Calculating precise numerical values for how often one prime number count is
ahead of another is even more delicate. It is no longer enough to argue that the sum is
“large” or “small”; we need to know exactly how often the sum in (3) is greater than
−1/2 or less than −1/2, since that value is where the right-hand side switches between
positive and negative. As it turns out, it is possible to calculate exactly how often this
occurs if we use (traditional) Fourier analysis: we rewrite the sum of the waves in (3)
in which the frequencies depend on the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function as a sum of
“Fourier waves” whose frequencies depend on the numbers 2πn. Although this is too
cumbersome to give in a closed form, one can, with clever computational techniques,
approximate its numerical value with great accuracy.

Squares and nonsquares: Littlewood’s method. On several occasions we have en-
countered consequences of Littlewood’s 1914 paper.
15 The method is robust enough
to prove some fairly general results but not typically about one progression racing an-
other.
16 Indeed, for any odd prime q let Team S be the set of primes that are congruent
to a square modulo q, and let Team N be the rest of the primes. Using Littlewood’s
method one can show that each such team takes the lead inﬁnitely often,
17 and the lead
up to x can be as large as c√x ln ln ln x/ ln x for some positive constant c that depends
only on q. One example of this is in the q = 5 race, where S contains the primes with
last digits 1 and 9 (as well as 5), so this is the Mod 10 Race again. Recall that we
observed in the limited data in Tables 3 and 4 that Team N typically held the lead.
There are other races that can be analyzed by Littlewood’s method, always involving
partitioning the primes into two seemingly equal classes. In fact, there is at least one
such race for every modulus q, and often more than one. When q is not a prime,
however, the descriptions of the appropriate classes become more complicated.

More results from Rubinstein and Sarnak (1994). In a prime number race between
two arithmetic progressions modulo q, when do we see a bias and when not? Is each
arithmetic progression “in the lead” exactly 50% of the time (in the logarithmic mea-
sure) or not? More importantly perhaps, can we decide this before doing a difﬁcult
calculation? Earlier we saw that there “usually” seem to be more primes up to x of the
form qn + b than of the form qn + a if a is a square modulo q and b is not. Indeed,
under our two assumptions (that is, the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis and the lin-
ear independence of the relevant γ s), Rubinstein and Sarnak proved that this is true:
the logarithmic measure of the set of x for which there are more primes of the form
qn + b up to x than of the form qn + a is strictly greater than 1/2, although always
less than 1. In other words, any nonsquare is ahead of any square more than half the
time, though not 100% of the time.
We can ask the same question when a and b are either both squares modulo q or
both nonsquares modulo q. In this case, under the same assumptions, Rubinstein and
Sarnak demonstrated that

#{primes qn + a ≤ x} > #{primes qn + b ≤ x}

exactly half the time. As a matter of fact, they prove rather more than this. To describe
their result, we need to deﬁne certain error terms related to these prime number counts

15Which actually dealt only with the π(x) versus Li(x) race.
16Though that was all we saw in the cases where q was small.
17In other words, there are arbitrarily large x and y such that there are more primes in S than in N up to x,
and there are more primes in N than in S up to y.

20 c⃝ THE MATHEMATICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA [Monthly 113

and describe what we mean by their “limiting distributions.” As noted, the values of
the prime counting function #{primes qn + a ≤ x} are all roughly equal as we vary
over the integers a up to q that have no factor in common with q. In fact, we saw that
the ratio of any two of them tended to 1 as x → ∞. This implies that

#{primes qn + a ≤ x}
π(x)/φ(q) → 1

as x → ∞, where π(x) = #{primes ≤ x} as before and φ(q) is the number of positive
integers a up to q for which gcd(a, q) = 1. We have seen that it is natural to look at
the difference in these quantities divided by √x/ ln x, so we deﬁne

Error (x; q, a) = #{primes qn + a ≤ x} − π(x)/φ(q)
√x/ ln x .

Rubinstein and Sarnak suggested that to study prime races between arithmetic pro-
gressions a (mod q) and b (mod q) properly, one should look at the distribution of
values of the ordered pair
 (Error(x; q, a), Error(x; q, b))

as x varies, this distribution again being deﬁned with respect to the logarithmic mea-
sure. More concretely, given real numbers α < β and α′ < β ′, one might ask how often
it is the case that α ≤ Error(x; q, a) ≤ β and α′ ≤ Error(x; q, b) ≤ β ′. This frequency
is deﬁned by the limit of integrals

lim
Y →∞ 1
ln Y
 ∫
 0 ≤ y ≤ Y,
Error(y; q, a) ∈ [α, β],
Error(y; q, b) ∈ [α′, β′]
 dy
y

(a limit that they proved exists). Rubinstein and Sarnak established that if a and b are
both squares or both nonsquares modulo q, then this distribution is symmetric, in the
sense that
 α ≤ Error(x; q, a) ≤ β, α′ ≤ Error(x; q, b) ≤ β ′

happens as often as

α′ ≤ Error(x; q, a) ≤ β ′, α ≤ Error(x; q, b) ≤ β.

In other words, there is no sign of any bias, of any form, at all: the arithmetic progres-
sions a (mod q) and b(mod q) are interchangeable in the limit.
This was all studied in much more generality. For example, one can ask about the
twenty-four possible orderings of the four prime number counts

#{primes 8n + 1 ≤ x}, #{primes 8n + 3 ≤ x},

#{primes 8n + 5 ≤ x}, #{primes 8n + 7 ≤ x}.

Rubinstein and Sarnak showed that each ordering occurs for inﬁnitely many values of
x; in fact, each ordering occurs a positive proportion of the time (in the logarithmic
measure). This can be generalized to all moduli q and to as many distinct arithmetic
progressions a1, . . . , ar (mod q) as one likes. That is, one can study the distribution of

January 2006] PRIME NUMBER RACES 21

(Error(x; q, a1), Error(x; q, a2), . . . , Error(x; q, ar )).

Assuming only the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, they prove that the distribu-
tion function
18 for this vector of error terms exists. Assuming also the linear inde-
pendence of the pertinent γ s over the rational numbers, they prove that for distinct
a1, . . . , ar (mod q), none of which has any factors in common with q, the ordering

#{primes qn + a1 ≤ x} < #{primes qn + a2 ≤ x} < · · · < #{primes qn + ar ≤ x}

occurs for a positive proportion (under the logarithmic measure) of values x. They also
proved that, for any ﬁxed r , these proportions get increasingly close to 1/r ! as q gets
larger. It seems extremely unlikely that this proportion is usually exactly 1/r !, but we
cannot prove that it is or isn’t except in the following special situation.
Earlier we saw that the distribution function is symmetric when we have a two-
progression race and the progressions are either both squares or both nonsquares mod-
ulo q. Surprisingly, Rubinstein and Sarnak showed that there is only one other situation
in which the distribution function is symmetric no matter how we swap the variables
with one another, namely, the race between three arithmetic progressions of the form

a (mod q), aω (mod q), aω2 (mod q),

where ω3 ≡ 1(mod q) but ω ̸≡ 1(mod q). However, Rubinstein and Sarnak’s result
that the distribution function is not usually symmetric still leaves open the possibility
that each ordering in a race occurs with the same frequency.19

In discussing Shanks’s histogram of values of Error(x; 4, 3) − Error(x; 4, 1) for
various values of x, we guessed that “the histogram will more and more resemble
something like a bell-shaped curve centered at 1” as we take more data points. One
perhaps surprising consequence of the work of Rubinstein and Sarnak is that this most
obvious guess is not the correct one: although there is a distribution function, it will
not be as simple and elegant as the classical “normal distribution” bell curve.

4. WHAT RESEARCH IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW? After Littlewood’s great
(and, at the time, quite surprising) results in 1914, there was a lull in research in “com-
parative prime number theory” until the ﬁfties and sixties. At that time, Littlewood’s
ideas were extended in several theoretical directions that were arguably suggested di-
rectly by Littlewood’s work and by substantial calculations of Shanks, Hudson, and
others. By the nineties, it appeared that most of what could be done in this subject
had been done (and that much would never be done), although Kaczorowski was still
proving some new results at this time.
In 1993, Giuliana Davidoff taught a senior-level undergraduate course at Mount
Holyoke College in analytic number theory. Finding so many interested students, Pro-
fessor Davidoff decided that she could run a fun “Research Experience for Under-
graduates” (REU) that summer investigating prime number races. Along with students
Caroline Osowski, Jennifer vanden Eynden, Yi Wang, and Nancy Wrinkle, she did
some important calculations and proved several results that will be stated in section 5.
By chance, Davidoff met Sarnak on summer vacation. She described her REU
project and how they were developing the computational approach of Stark to such
problems. In an e-mail to the ﬁrst-named author Sarnak wrote: “I was not familiar
with this Chebyshev bias feature and became fascinated. In particular I was . . . very
interested to put a deﬁnite number as to the probability of π(x) beating Li(x).”

18Deﬁned by a certain limit of integrals, analogous to the limit a few lines earlier.
19Since, for example, a function can be positive half the time without being symmetric.

22 c⃝ THE MATHEMATICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA [Monthly 113

Sarnak continued: “When I got back to Princeton I chatted with Fernando20 about
this . . . and began to work on this. . . . It was clear that many zeroes would have to
be computed.” Sarnak had previously discussed other questions on the distribution of
prime numbers with a bright undergraduate, Mike Rubinstein. “Mike, who was looking
for a senior thesis topic, got very involved in this and after a while he and I worked on
the problem as collaborators and this led to our paper.” This was quite an extraordinary
senior thesis, as it became one of the most inﬂuential papers in recent analytic number
theory. Subsequently Rubinstein went on to get his Ph.D. and has become one of the
world’s leading researchers in the computation of different types and aspects of zeta-
functions.
21

Soon thereafter, the second-named author read Rubinstein and Sarnak’s paper and
became interested in determining the “probabilities” for some of the three-way prime
number races that Rubinstein and Sarnak’s work did not address—for example, the
race between the three contestants

#{primes 8n + 3 ≤ x}, #{primes 8n + 5 ≤ x}, #{primes 8n + 7 ≤ x}.

Note that none of these arithmetic progressions contains any squares.
With colleague Andrey Feuerverger at the University of Toronto,22 he created a
technique to determine the frequencies of the various orderings of contestants in a
prime number race with more than two contestants. Unexpectedly, they found that the
six orderings of the three contestants in the race just cited do not necessarily each
happen one sixth of the time. In fact,

#{primes 8n + 3 ≤ x} > #{primes 8n + 5 ≤ x} > #{primes 8n + 7 ≤ x}

holds for approximately 19.2801% of integers x (in the logarithmic measure), while

#{primes 8n + 5 ≤ x} > #{primes 8n + 3 ≤ x} > #{primes 8n + 7 ≤ x}

holds for approximately 14.0772% of integers x (under appropriate assumptions).
This is strange, for in the race between primes of the form 8n + 3 and primes of the
form 8n + 5 both contestants are in the lead half the time, yet if we look only at values
of x for which both of these prime number counts are ahead of the count for primes of
the form 8n + 7, then the 8n + 3 primes are more likely to be ahead!

More esoteric races. The ﬁrst author’s involvement in the topic of this paper came
from an invitation to speak at an MAA meeting in Montgomery, Alabama, in 2001,
which gave him an excuse to read up on this fascinating subject. A subsequent dis-
cussion with students led to the creation of a 2001—2002 summer VIGRE research
group at the University of Georgia to investigate analogous questions about “twin
prime races”—races that investigate how many pairs of primes differ by two or four or
six or any ﬁxed even number. In section 5, we present the work of a team of students at
the University of Georgia who sought further data and tried to make predictions about
such races.

There are results known that give asymptotics for the number of primes having
certain properties. For example, when is 2 a cube modulo the prime p? It is easy to see
that this is the case for all primes of the form 3n + 2, so we focus on the other primes.
It is known that, asymptotically, 2 is a cube for one-third of the primes of the form
3n + 1. We thus ask whether, typically, slightly more or slightly less than one-third of
the primes p = 3n + 1 have the property that 2 is a cube modulo p.
In his recent doctoral thesis at the University of British Columbia, Nathan Ng23

noted that this question can be answered using techniques similar to those of Rubin-
stein and Sarnak, since the count of these primes depends in an analogous way on the
zeros of yet another type of L-function. Indeed, Ng observed that such results can be
generalized to many cases in which we know the asymptotics for a set of primes that
can be described by Galois theory.
24

Ng gave the following nice example of his work. Power series like

q
 ∞∏

n=1(1 − q n)(1 − q 23n) =
 ∞∑

n=1 anq n

appear frequently in arithmetic geometry: this is an example of a modular form, and
it has all sorts of seemingly miraculous properties (see Serre’s book [23]). One such
miracle is that for every prime p the value of a p is 2, 0, or −1 and that the proportions
of each are around 1/6, 1/2, and 1/3, respectively. Under the appropriate assumptions
Ng showed that, in the logarithmic measure,

2#{ p ≤ x, a p = 0} > 6#{ p ≤ x, a p = 2} for ≈ 98.30% of the values of x,

2#{ p ≤ x, a p = 0} > 3#{ p ≤ x, a p = −1} for ≈ 72.46% of the values of x,

and
3#{ p ≤ x, a p = −1} > 6#{ p ≤ x, a p = 2} for ≈ 95.70% of the values of x.

There are several other natural questions pertaining to prime number races that have
been the subject of research over the last few years.

It can take a long time to take the lead. Although Team 1 does occasionally get
ahead in the Mod 4 Race, it takes quite a while for this to happen. For instance, x is
larger than 25,000 the ﬁrst time Team 1 takes the lead and then only momentarily; the
ﬁrst time Team 1 sustains the lead over a longer interval occurs when x is larger than
half a million. Similarly, in the Mod 3 Race, x is larger than half a trillion before Team
1 takes the lead. In the π(x) versus Li(x) race, we still do not know exactly when π(x)
ﬁrst grabs the lead, though the answer is deﬁnitely gigantic.
Another situation is where one team is ganged up on by the other teams. For in-
stance, we saw that primes of the form 8n + 1 lag far behind primes of the forms
8n + 3, 8n + 5, or 8n + 7 (because all the odd squares, including squares of primes,
are of the form 8n + 1, a heavy burden on Team 1). In fact, the ﬁrst time that Team
1 even gets out of last place is beyond half a billion: x = 588, 067, 889 is the ﬁrst
time that there are more primes of the form 8n + 1 up to x than there are primes of

23Nathan Ng is now an assistant professor at the University of Ottawa.
24The L-functions in question are Artin L-functions, and the asymptotics for conjugacy classes under the ap-
propriate Frobenius maps are obtained by Cebotarev’s density theorem. Analogous results are proved under the
assumption of holomorphy for these L-functions as well as the Riemann Hypothesis and linear independence
over the rationals of their zeros.

24 c⃝ THE MATHEMATICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA [Monthly 113

the form 8n + 5. Moreover, x is roughly 1.9282 × 10
14 before there are more primes
of the form 8n + 1 up to x than there are primes of the form 8n + 7. Kaczorowski
and, independently, Rubinstein and Sarnak showed that Team 1 runs in ﬁrst place in
this four-way race for a positive proportion of values of x; however, the ﬁrst time this
occurs is beyond 1028.
So why does it take so long for some competitors to get their turn in the lead? To
understand this we need to examine the most “important” terms in formulas like (3),
namely, the “1” term and the ﬁrst few summands, those for which γ is small. Looking
closely at formula (3), we see that these ﬁrst few summands, which correspond to the
nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function that are closest to the real axis, have
γ approximately equal to 14.13, then 21.02, 25.01, 30.42, . . . . In particular, these
summands are all less than 1/7 in absolute value, which is small relative to the “1”
term. Even if we could ﬁnd a value of x for which many of the initial terms sin(γ ln x)
are close to −1, it would take at least the ﬁrst twenty-one terms of the sum to be
negative enough to compensate for the initial “1” term. Thus these values of x must be
special in that many of the sin(γ ln x) terms must be close to −1 simultaneously.
If we look at the Mod q Race as q gets larger, it turns out that the relevant numbers
γ become smaller (that is, the zeros of the appropriate Dirichlet L-functions lie closer
to the real axis). As a result, changes in the lead happen sooner and more frequently.
However, tiny values of γ come with their own problems. For example, when
q = 163 the relevant sum has an especially small γ , namely, γ ≈ 0.2029. This one
summand has a large impact on the ﬁnal answer since its denominator is so small. The
ﬁrst time sin(γ ln x) is close to −1 occurs when γ ln x is close to 3π/2, which corre-
sponds to a value of x around twelve billion! And if that x doesn’t work out because
of the other terms, then the next such value is when γ ln x is close to 7π/2, which
corresponds to x ≈ 3.43 × 10
23. No wonder it can take a while to see the predicted
effects!

Sharing the lead. In a race between two contestants who keep taking the lead from
one another, there will be plenty of moments when the two contestants are tied. Rea-
son: because there are arbitrarily large values of x for which

#{primes qn + a ≤ x} > #{primes qn + b ≤ x}

as well as arbitrarily large values for which

#{primes qn + a ≤ x} < #{primes qn + b ≤ x}

and because these counting functions take only integer values, there must be inﬁnitely
many integers x for which

#{primes qn + a ≤ x} = #{primes qn + b ≤ x}.

What about races with three or more contestants? Even if each of the contestants
leads at some point, there seems to be no particular reason for all three of them to be
tied at any point. So we ask: Do there exist inﬁnitely many integers x for which

#{primes qn + a ≤ x} = #{primes qn + b ≤ x} = #{primes qn + c ≤ x} = · · ·?

Feuerverger and Martin conjecture that there are inﬁnitely many such ties in a three-
way Mod q Race, but not in a Mod q Race with four or more teams. Their compelling
argument runs as follows: Consider the (k − 1)-dimensional vector whose ith entry is
the difference

January 2006] PRIME NUMBER RACES 25

#{primes qn + ai ≤ x} − #{primes qn + ai+1 ≤ x} (5)

for i = 1, 2, . . . , k − 1. Notice that the k counting functions #{primes qn + ai ≤ x}
are all tied with one another precisely if this (k − 1)-dimensional vector has the value
(0, 0, . . . , 0). As we let x increase, this vector changes each time x equals a prime
number in one of the arithmetic progressions we are counting, changed by adding one
of the vectors

(1, 0, . . . , 0), (−1, 1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , (0, . . . , 0, −1, 1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , (0, . . . , 0, −1),
(6)

depending on whether the prime is of the form qn + a1 or qn + a2 or . . . qn + ak,
respectively. The prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions tells us that each
of these vectors is roughly equally likely to occur.
From this, Feuerverger and Martin suggest that the progress of the (k − 1)-
dimensional vector in (5) can be modelled by a “random walk” on the (k − 1)-
dimensional lattice generated by the vectors listed in (6). Now it is known that, with
probability one, a random walk on a one- or two-dimensional lattice will return to the
origin (indeed, will visit every lattice point) inﬁnitely often but a random walk on a
lattice of dimension three or greater will return to the origin only ﬁnitely often. This
is the source of Feuerverger and Martin’s conjecture, since the lattices of dimension
one and two in this model correspond to prime number races with two and three
contestants, respectively.

Certain special symmetries. Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, Feuer-
verger and Martin proved that certain conﬁgurations

#{primes qn + a1 ≤ x} < #{primes qn + a2 ≤ x} < · · · < #{primes qn + ar ≤ x}

occur just as often
25 as certain other conﬁgurations

#{primes qn + b1 ≤ x} < #{primes qn + b2 ≤ x} < · · · < #{primes qn + br ≤ x}

in the following situations:

• the ai s and bi s are inverses of each other modulo q; that is, ai bi ≡ 1(mod q) for
all i;

• the list of bi s is just the reversal of the list of ai s (that is, bi = ar +1−i for all i) and
are either all squares modulo q or all nonsquares modulo q;

• there exists an integer m such that ai ≡ mbi (mod q) for each i, and in addition,
one of the following holds: the ai s are all squares modulo q, or for each i the two
numbers ai and bi are either both squares modulo q or both nonsquares modulo q.

Probably the orderings appear with different frequencies if they are not related by some
special symmetry of this type.

25With respect to the logarithmic measure of the set of such values x.

And what if the Riemann Hypothesis is false? If the Generalized Riemann Hy-
pothesis is false, it turns out to be easier to prove that #{primes qn + a ≤ x} >
#{primes qn + b ≤ x} for a positive proportion
26 of x, since the “1” term in the for-
mula analogous to (3) becomes irrelevant, and this was what caused the bias when
we assumed the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. However, whether one can prove
that this happens 50% of the time is still in doubt. If one could prove this under the
assumption that the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis were false, then we would have
an unconditional proof that the Mod q Race between two squares or two nonsquares
is always an even race (by combining such a proof with the work of Rubinstein and
Sarnak).
The behavior of prime number races might be genuinely different if the General-
ized Riemann Hypothesis does not hold. In 2001, Ford and Konyagin proved that if the
Generalized Riemann Hypothesis is false—false in an absurdly convenient, yet feasi-
ble, way—then there are some orderings of the prime number counting functions that
never occur.
To describe one of their constructions, we need to discuss a generalization of the
Riemann zeta-function. Deﬁne χ to be that function for which

χ(5m) = 0, χ(5m ± 1) = ±1, χ(5m ± 2) = ±i

for all integers m, and let L(s, χ) = ∑
n≥1 χ(n)/ns (this is another example of a
Dirichlet L-function). Suppose that the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis is true ex-
cept that L(s, χ) has a single zero σ + iγ with σ > 1/2 and γ ≥ 0 and that L(s, ¯χ )
has a zero at σ − iγ as well (zeros always come in conjugate pairs). The formula
analogous to (3) is

#{primes 5n + a ≤ x} − 1
4 π(x)
x σ / ln x ≈ −2Re (χ(a) cos(γ log x) + i sin(γ log x)
σ + iγ
 )

when 1 ≤ a ≤ 4. If we work this out explicitly, we see that

1
2 (σ 2 + γ 2) #{primes 5n + 1 ≤ x} − 1
4 π(x)
x σ / ln x ≈ −σ cos(γ ln x) − γ sin(γ ln x),

1
2 (σ 2 + γ 2) #{primes 5n + 2 ≤ x} − 1
4 π(x)
x σ / ln x ≈ σ sin(γ ln x) − γ cos(γ ln x),

1
2 (σ 2 + γ 2) #{primes 5n + 3 ≤ x} − 1
4 π(x)
x σ / ln x ≈ −σ sin(γ ln x) + γ cos(γ ln x),

1
2 (σ 2 + γ 2) #{primes 5n + 4 ≤ x} − 1
4 π(x)
x σ / ln x ≈ σ cos(γ ln x) + γ sin(γ ln x).

Amazingly, this implies that the conﬁguration

#{primes 5n + 3 ≤ x} < #{primes 5n + 2 ≤ x}

< #{primes 5n + 4 ≤ x} < #{primes 5n + 1 ≤ x}

26In the logarithmic measure.

January 2006] PRIME NUMBER RACES 27

cannot occur when x is sufﬁciently large! Why? The ﬁrst inequality implies that

−σ sin(γ ln x) + γ cos(γ ln x) ⪅ σ sin(γ ln x) − γ cos(γ ln x)

or, equivalently, that
 0 ⪅ σ sin(γ ln x) − γ cos(γ ln x),

where the ⪅ symbol means that the inequality holds up to an error that goes to
zero as x tends to inﬁnity. Similarly, the third inequality implies that σ cos(γ ln x) +
γ sin(γ ln x) ⪅ 0. The three-inequality conﬁguration is therefore equivalent to

0 ⪅ σ sin(γ ln x) − γ cos(γ ln x) ⪅ σ cos(γ ln x) + γ sin(γ ln x) ⪅ 0,

which implies that both
 σ sin(γ ln x) − γ cos(γ ln x) ≈ 0

and
 σ cos(γ ln x) + γ sin(γ ln x) ≈ 0.

However, multiplying by sin(γ ln x) and cos(γ ln x), respectively, yields

σ sin2(γ ln x) − γ cos(γ ln x) sin(γ ln x) ≈ 0

and
 σ cos2(γ ln x) + γ cos(γ ln x) sin(γ ln x) ≈ 0.

Adding these together yields

σ = σ sin
2(γ ln x) + σ cos2(γ ln x) ≈ 0,

which is ridiculous: it would imply that σ tends to 0 as x goes to inﬁnity, yet we know
that σ > 1/2!
Ford and Konyagin proved more. For any three arithmetic progressions modulo
q there is a feasible (but equally unlikely) way to prescribe Generalized-Riemann-
Hypothesis-violating zeros of the appropriate Dirichlet L-functions that would cause
one of the six orderings of the three arithmetic progressions not to occur beyond a
certain x-value. Moreover, the zeros in these conﬁgurations can be placed arbitrarily
far from the real axis, which implies that there is no way for us to rule out such a
possibility by a ﬁnite computation. It seems that their method can be extended to show
that certain races between just two arithmetic progressions keep the same leader from
some point onwards, provided there is another technically feasible, but rather unlikely,
contradiction to the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. In summary, their results seem
to indicate that it will be very difﬁcult to obtain deﬁnitive results independent of any
unproved hypothesis.

5. UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH PROJECTS.

The Mount Holyoke College REU. This program consisted of students Caroline
Osowski, Jennifer vanden Eynden, Yi Wang, and Nancy Wrinkle, led by Giuliana
Davidoff, who describes the experience:
In my senior class in analytic number theory, I had asked students to collect data
on various pertinent questions so as to conjecture a forthcoming theorem and then to
report their results to the whole class. Having seen many examples where the theo-

28 c⃝ THE MATHEMATICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA [Monthly 113

rems matched the initial experimental evidence, I asked them to collect data on the
Mod 4 Race and then surprised them with Littlewood’s theorem. Next we decided to
investigate the Mod 3, 5, 7, and 11 Races, in particular whether Team N, the set of
primes that are not congruent to squares modulo q, consistently leads over Team S,
the set of primes that are congruent to squares modulo q. The results found were in-
triguingly different from one modulus to another, so we decided to study this during
the upcoming summer REU program.
The students began by tracking down anything in the existing literature on sign
changes and posting an appeal on a number theory website. Within days we had re-
ceived a generous response from Andrew Odlyzko, who pointed us to relevant data of
Robert Rumely. This allowed us to begin our own work in earnest.
We were most fascinated by a 1971 paper of Harold Stark [25], in which he sug-
gested a method to study prime races between primes from any two given arithmetic
progressions. Back then, there was no general procedure known to prove that each
team took the lead inﬁnitely often in the race between the primes of the form qn + a
and the primes of the form qn + b, where a is a square modulo q and b is not. Stark’s
results thus pertained to the ﬁrst case not covered by the prior work of Littlewood [18]
and of Knapowski and Tur«an [16], [17]. As he himself pointed out, it seemed particu-
larly difﬁcult to show that qn + a leads inﬁnitely often, even in the case of primes of
the form 5n + 4 racing against primes of the form 5n + 2.
Stark rephrased the problem in terms of two auxiliary functions (which are com-
plicated expressions, analogous to (3), given in terms of zeros of various Dirichlet L-
functions) and, in doing so, created a beautiful setting in which he obtained a theorem
from a numerical calculation. In this manner he was able to show that

#{primes 5n + 4 ≤ x} > #{primes 5n + 2 ≤ x}

for arbitrarily large values of x, assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. In fact
he proved this with an assumption weaker than the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis:
one needs only that the Dirichlet L-functions associated with this race have no real
zeros in the interval (1/2, 1).
The REU group began by making a detailed numerical study of Stark’s formula (for
his Mod 5 Race) in order to appreciate how his complicated expressions vary with the
actual numbers of primes: we found that there are very good correlations, though a
little less so when we used fewer zeros to approximate the formula analogous to the
right-hand side of (3).
Using Stark’s results and our own numerical calculations, we were able to prove the
by now expected result in the ﬁrst cases not treated by him [6]:

Theorem. Assume that Dirichlet L-functions have no real zeros in the interval
(1/2, 1). For a = 1, 2, or 4 (the squares modulo 7) and b = 3, 5, or 6 (the non-
squares modulo 7) there are arbitrarily large values of x for which

#{primes 7n + a ≤ x} > #{primes 7n + b ≤ x}.

In fact, there exists a positive constant c such that there are arbitrarily large values of
x for which

#{primes 7n + a ≤ x} − #{primes 7n + b ≤ x} > c√x/ log x.

The proof of the theorem is based on calculations of Stark’s formula using available
tables of zeros of Dirichlet L-functions. We could have perhaps gone on to settle this
question about races, one prime modulus at a time.

January 2006] PRIME NUMBER RACES 29

However, the question that initially interested us was whether Team S takes the
lead over Team N for arbitrarily large x. To study this we had to modify Stark’s for-
mulas appropriately: this time we found that the formulas involve only the zeros of the
Dirichlet L-function
 ∑

n≥1
 (n/q)
ns , (7)

where (n/q) = 1 if n is a square modulo q, (n/q) = 0 if q divides n, and (n/q) = −1
if n is not a square mod q.
We found the same remarkable correlations between the actual count of primes and
our approximation. Had the summer not ended, we would surely have proved that the
lead changes hands inﬁnitely often in this Mod 7 race.
I was later able to go on and prove [7] that the lead changes hands inﬁnitely often
in the Team S vs. Team N race for any modulus q, assuming a weak version of the
Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. One needs to assume only that any real zero of the
Dirichlet L-function (7) lies to the left of the least upper bound of the real parts of the
complex zeros (which holds, in particular, when the Dirichlet L-function has no real
zeros).

The University of Georgia VIGRE. This research group consisted of students
Michael Beck, Zubeyir Cinkir, Brian Lawler, Eric Pine, Paul Pollack, Charles Pooh,
and Michael Guy (who describes their ﬁndings in this subsection), with postdoctoral
mentor Jim Solazzo.
For any even number 2k we believe that there are inﬁnitely many integers n for
which both n and n + 2k are prime. When 2k = 2, this is the famous Twin Prime
Conjecture. At present, we cannot prove that there are inﬁnitely many “prime pairs”
n and n + 2k for any value of 2k whatsoever. Nonetheless, we can predict how many
there should be. The following conjecture as to how many such pairs there are up to x
is due, essentially, to Hardy and Littlewood [12]:

The Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture. Let k be a positive integer, and let π2k(x) be the
number of prime pairs ( p, p + 2k) with p ≤ x. Then

π2k(x) ∼ 2C2 ∏

p|k, p>2
 ( p − 1
p − 2
 ) · Li2(x),

where
 C2 = ∏

p>2
 (1 − 1
( p − 1)2
 )

and
 Li2(x) = ∫ x

2
 d x
(log x)2 .

We decided to investigate this problem by collecting and analyzing data. Our pro-
gram found pairs of primes using a modiﬁed sieve of Eratosthenes and then counted
them. Some of the initial data is collected in Table 8.

Notice that the counts for 2k = 2, 4, and 8 are very close. We graphed the data for
each value of 2k ≤ 30, noticing that π2k(x) and π2ℓ(x) are close if the prime factors
of 2k and of 2ℓ are the same. Indeed, Hardy and Littlewood’s conjecture predicts that
π2k(x) ∼ π2ℓ(x) in these circumstances, so we felt it would be interesting to study this
“twin-prime race.”
If we wish to compare π2(x) and π6(x), then it makes sense to “renormalize” so
that the predictions of Hardy and Littlewood are the same for both. In other words, the
conjecture predicts that π6(x)/2 should be approximately π2(x), so it makes sense to
compare these two quantities. More generally, we deﬁne

Hardy and Littlewood’s conjecture predicts that π ′
2k(X ) ∼ πH L(X ) for all k, so we
have tabulated their difference (Table 9):

What a remarkable ﬁt! It looks like |π ′
2k(x) − πH L(x)| is usually well less than √x.
In fact, we collected data for k = 1, 2, . . . , 50 in this range of x, and this prediction
seems always to be very good.
However, this is a paper about prime races, and we wanted to investigate further
whether there are any particular winners or losers to this race. At the beginning of our
investigation, we seemed to have spotted what we thought were winners and losers in
the race. It appeared that the pairs ( p, p + 60) and ( p, p + 80) were ahead of the other

January 2006] PRIME NUMBER RACES 31

pairs with the same prime divisors, based on data up to 5 · 10
9. On the other hand, after
counting up to 10
12 they were no longer regularly the winners. Similarly, several prime
pairs were consistently the losers at the start of the prime twin race, but after a while
there were no consistent losers. As an interesting tidbit, our program noted that there
were 14,455 changes in ﬁrst place between 10
3 and 10
9!
In the end, this appears to be a race in which there are no particular winners or
losers, and still lots of unanswered questions. The main problem in analyzing these
prime pairs races is that we have no idea what formula similar to (3) would count
prime pairs as a sum of nice “waves.”
