Abstract

The Collatz conjecture (or “Syracuse problem”) considers recursively-deﬁned se-
quences of positive integers where n is succeeded by n
2 , if n is even, or 3n+1
2 , if n is odd.
The conjecture states that for all starting values n the sequence eventually reaches the
trivial cycle 1, 2, 1, 2, . . . . We are interested in the existence of nontrivial cycles.
Let m be the number of local minima in such a nontrivial cycle. Simons and de
Weger proved that m ≥ 76. With newer bounds on the range of starting values for
which the Collatz conjecture has been checked, one gets m ≥ 83. In this paper, we
prove m ≥ 92.
The last part of this paper considers what must be proven in order to raise the
number of odd members a nontrivial cycle has to have to the next bound—that is, to
at least K ≥ 1.375 · 1011. We prove that it suﬃces to show that, for every integer
smaller than or equal to 1536 · 260 = 3 · 269, the respective Collatz sequence enters the
trivial cycle. This reduces the range of numbers to be checked by nearly 60%.

1 Introduction

The Collatz conjecture
1 (or Syracuse problem) considers recursively-deﬁned sequences of
positive integers.

Deﬁnition 1. Let n be a positive integer. The Collatz operator C : Z>0 → Z>0 is deﬁned
as follows:
 C(n) :=
 { n
2 , if n is even;

3n+1
2 , if n is odd.

We deﬁne an e-step to be of type n ↦→ n
2 , since it occurs after an even number n, and an
o-step to be of type n ↦→ 3n+1
2 , since it follows after an odd number n.

1Named after German mathematician Lothar Collatz, 1910–1990.

Conjecture 2 (Collatz). For all n ∈ Z>0, the sequence n, C(n), C 2(n) := C(C(n)), C 3(n), . . .
eventually reaches the trivial cycle 1, 2, 1, 2, . . . .

Remark 3. While the Collatz conjecture is currently unproven, there are good reasons to
believe it holds. In [14], for example, Terras showed that the respective Collatz sequence
enters the trivial cycle for almost all integers. More recently, Tao also proved in [13] that,
for every function f : Z>0 → R with lim
n→∞ f (n) = ∞ and almost every positive integer n, the

Collatz sequence starting with n reaches a number less than or equal to f (n):

lim inf
k→∞ C k(n) ≤ f (n).

Nevertheless, the conjecture could be wrong in two possible ways:

• There could be an unbounded sequence n, C(n), . . . with lim supi→∞ C i(n) = ∞.

• There could be a nontrivial cycle n, C(n), . . . with C i(n) = n for some positive integer i.

This paper concerns itself with the second case. Speciﬁcally, we consider the properties a
nontrivial cycle would need to have.

Over time, diﬀerent projects, [6, 10, 7, 8, 4, 5, 1], have taken various approaches to prove
or disprove the Collatz conjecture by checking whether the respective sequences of increasing
numbers converge to the trivial cycle. The best known bound is from Barina [2]:

Deﬁnition 4. We deﬁne X0 as the largest number for which it is known that for all positive
integers n ≤ X0 their Collatz sequences reach the trivial cycle. As of the date of writing this
paper, we have X0 = 704 · 260.

Since the Collatz sequences converge to the trivial cycle for all numbers less than or equal
to X0, we can derive estimates of properties of hypothetically existing nontrivial cycles. On
the basis of the value of X0 known at the time, Eliahou [3] used methods derived from
diophantine approximation and continued fractions to prove that such a nontrivial cycle
must include at least K > 107 o-steps. This bound was subsequently improved by Hercher
and Puchert [4, 5, 9] to the current K > 7.2 · 1010 .
Another property of such a nontrivial cycle was investigated by Simons and de Weger [11].
As 3n+1
2 > n > n
2 , such a nontrivial cycle has strictly increasing and strictly decreasing
passages:

Deﬁnition 5. Let n, C(n), . . . , C i(n) = n be a nontrivial cycle. (That is, n > 2.) Let us call
it an m-cycle if it has exactly m local minima (and therefore also exactly m local maxima).

Simons and de Weger [11] proved that m ≥ 68 for every nontrivial cycle. Based on the
rate of growth of X0 in the year 2005, when [11] appeared, they estimated that bounds on
m like m ≥ 77 were unlikely to be obtained before the year 2419. In an updated version

2

of the paper [12] in 2010, the same authors used what was then a new bound X0 to prove
that m ≥ 76. Regarding future bounds, estimates suggested that m ≥ 83 could not be
reached before the year 2429 if progress on X0 maintained the then-current pace and no new
insights into the topic emerged. In 2018, Hercher [4, 5]—using his newly derived bound on
X0—proved that m ≥ 77.
With the current best bound on X0, Simons and de Weger [11, 12] suggested that with
methods of their paper m ≥ 83 could be proven.
2 In this paper, we prove that m ≥ 92.

1.1 Outline

In Section 2, we consider sums of the form T (ni) = ∑ki
k=0 1
Ck(ni). This is the sum of the
reciprocals of the odd numbers starting with and following a local minimum ni in an m-
cycle. In Remark 7, Lemma 11, and Corollary 13, we give subsequently improving upper
bounds on the average of these T (ni) in sets of up to three consecutive such terms. This
leads to Lemma 12 and Theorem 14, where we give bounds on sums of an arbitrary number
of consecutive T (ni).
This is motivated and used in Section 3. At the start of this section, some results
on nontrivial cycles in Collatz sequences are listed and proved in a way similar to that
in [3, 11, 4]. In particular, Theorem 16 gives bounds on the fraction K+L
K in terms of∑m
i=1 T (ni). Here, K is the number of odd and L the number of even entries in the cycle
and therefore the number of o-steps and e-steps, respectively. Together with the bounds on
such sums over T (ni) and further reﬁnements, this leads to better bounds on K+L
K . These
bounds are given in Corollary 17 and Theorem 21. (Corollary 19 is a version of Corollary 17
which gives an absolute bound independently of X0, where we used a computer program to
derive it.)
The proof of Theorem 21 is based on the idea that ki cannot grow at an unlimited rate:
There is a constant 1 < δ < 2 such that ki+j ≤ δj · log(ni+1)
log(2) for all i, j; see Lemma 20. Then
we split the sum ∑m
i=1 T (ni) into two parts. The ﬁrst one, with “small” ni, is bounded using
Theorem 14 from Section 2, and the second one with “large” and “growing” ki (and therefore
“large” ni, too). The second partial sum is estimated in the proof of Theorem 21 itself.
The results for the bounds on K+L
K can then be used together with Lemma 22. This
lemma states how to obtain the smallest possible denominator of all fractions in a given
nonempty open interval. We use this lemma in our main theorem, Theorem 23, to show that
there is no m-cycle with m ≤ 91. To do so, we assume m ≤ 91 and give a new lower bound
on K, which then can be used in the same way to get an even better lower bound, and so on.
Finally, we arrive at a proven lower bound on K which is larger than the upper bound for
this value of m given by Simons and de Weger [12]. This result shows that no such m-cycle
with m ≤ 91 can exist.
In the same way, we can give new lower bounds on K for m-cycles with m ≥ 92. A
selection of them is given in Corollary 24. The computations for Theorem 23 and Corollary 24

were done using a Sagemath worksheet, with the total computing time lasting a few minutes.
Finally, in Section 4 the methods of the previous sections are used to consider the case
of nontrivial Collatz cycles independent of m. The result on the average value of the T (ni)
yielded Lemma 26 is analogous to the ones given by Lemma 11 and Corollary 13. However
there the values T (ni) are weighted by the numbers ki. This is used to get Theorem 27,
which yields a result analogous to that of Corollary 17, but independent of m. As stated in
Remark 28, this lowers the value X0 has to have for proving K > 1.375·1011 (which is the next
threshold reachable) from 3781·260 to 2836·260. To get this result with an even smaller known
value of X0, we implemented the methods in a computer program which—after extensive
computations—proved Corollary 29, which states that already X0 ≥ 1536 · 260 = 3 · 269 is
suﬃcient.

2 Upper bounds on T (ni)

Deﬁnition 6. For a given m-cycle, we call the local minima in order of appearance in the
cycle n1, n2, . . . , nm. To keep the notation simple, we further set nm+1 := n1, nm+2 := n2
and so on. Note that we do not need n1 to be the smallest of these minima, as every cyclic
permutation of these minima yields to the same results. All we need is that, for all i, the
next local minimum after ni in this Collatz trajectory is ni+1.
Further let ki be the exact number of consecutive o-steps directly following the local
minimum ni, and let ℓi be the exact number of e-steps directly following them. Thus, the
numbers ni, C(ni), . . ., and C ki−1(ni) are all odd (as they are followed by an o-step) and
C ki(ni) is even. Therefore, C ki(ni) is the local maximum following ni. From that point on,
the numbers C ki(ni), C ki+1(ni), . . . and C ki+ℓi−1(ni) are all even (since they are followed by
an e-step) and C ki+ℓi(ni) is odd. Therefore, C ki+ℓi(ni) = ni+1 is the next local minimum
after ni.
For positive integers i, let
 T (ni) :=
 ki−1∑

t=0
 1
C t(ni).

Remark 7. We have T (ni) < 3
ni < 3
X0 for all 1 ≤ i.

Proof. As C(n) > 3
2n for odd n, we have C t(ni) ≥ ( 3
2)t · ni, and therefore

T (ni) =
 ki−1∑

t=0

C t(ni) <

ni < 3
X0 .

The last inequality follows from ni > X0.

Lemma 8. Let n and k be positive integers, where n, C(n), . . . , C k−1(n) are all odd. Then
n ≡ −1 (mod 2k). In particular, n ≥ 2k − 1.
 4

Proof. We proceed by induction on k to show that not only n ≡ −1 (mod 2k), but also
C k(n) = a · 3k − 1, if n = a · 2k − 1. If k = 1, then the statement is obvious: We have
n = a · 21 − 1 for some positive integer a and C 1(n) = a · 31 − 1.
Now let k be at least 2 and n, C(n), . . . , C k−2(n) all odd. Then there is a positive integer a
with n = a · 2k−1 − 1 and C k−1(n) = a · 3k−1 − 1. Since in order for C k−1(n) to be odd, a
must be even, a = 2a
′, n = a
′ · 2k − 1 and C k(n) = a
′ · 3k − 1. Thus, n ≡ −1 (mod 2k) and
n ≥ 2k − 1.

Note that this well-known statement has been used before and proven in many publica-
tions on this subject, e.g., [14].

Lemma 9. Let ni be an odd positive integer. Let ki be the exact number of o-steps directly
following ni in its Collatz sequence and ℓi the exact number of e-steps following them.
If ℓi ≥ 2, then the Collatz sequences of ni and n
′
i := ni−1
2 merge since C ki+2(ni) =
C ki+1(n
′
i).

Proof. Let ni, ki and ℓi be as in the lemma. Then, there is a positive integer a with ni =
a · 2ki+2 + 2ki − 1 if ki is even, or ni = a · 2ki+2 + 3 · 2ki − 1 if ki is odd. To see this, we recall
with Lemma 8 that ni is congruent to −1 modulo 2ki, but not modulo 2ki+1. Therefore,
there is a positive integer b with ni = b · 2ki+1 + 2ki − 1. With this, according to the proof
of Lemma 8 we get
 C ki+1(ni) = b · 3ki + 3ki − 1
2 = (2b + 1) · 3ki − 1
2 .

Since we want another e-step to follow this number, it has to be even. Hence, we get
(2b + 1) · 3ki ≡ 1 (mod 4). For even ki we have 3ki ≡ 1 (mod 4), thus, b = 2a has to be even.
For odd ki we have 3ki ≡ 3 (mod 4), such that b = 2a + 1 has to be odd.
If ki is even, this leads to the equality C ki+2(ni) = a·3ki + 3ki −1
4 . But this number is also a
Collatz successor of the number n
′
i := ni−1
2 = a · 2ki+1 + 2ki−1 − 1, since through n
′
i ≡ 2ki−1 − 1
(mod 2ki) we get C ki(n
′
i) = a · 2 · 3ki−1 + 3ki−1−1
2 . But when ki is even we know that 3ki−1−1
2
is odd and that, therefore, C ki(n
′
i) is odd, too. As a result, we get

C ki+1(n
′
i) = a · 3ki + 3ki − 1
4 = C ki+2(ni).

Similarly, for odd ki we get

C ki+1(ni) = (2(2a + 1) + 1) · 3ki − 1
2 = 4a · 3ki + 3 · 3ki − 1
2

= 2a · 3ki + 3ki+1 − 1
2

and therefore C ki+2(ni) = a · 3ki + 3ki+1−1
4 . Now this is C ki+1(n
′
i) with n
′
i = ni−1
2 = a · 2ki+1 +
3 · 2ki−1 − 1, too: By n
′
i ≡ 2ki−1 − 1 (mod 2ki), we know C ki(n
′
i) = a · 2 · 3ki−1 + 3ki−1−1
2 . As

5

ki is odd, C ki(n
′
i) is odd, too, and we get

C ki+1(n
′
i) = a · 3ki + 3ki − 1
4 = C ki+2(ni).

Remark 10. From this lemma we also get a small result for unbounded Collatz sequences:
Let n1 be the smallest positive integer, if any, for which the Collatz sequence is un-
bounded. Let k1 and ℓ1 be as above. Then ℓ1 = 1 and k1 ≥ 2. (If ℓ1 were greater, then there
would be a smaller number n
′
1 which would also have an unbounded Collatz sequence, and
this would contradict the minimality of n1. The same would hold, if k1 = ℓ1 = 1, since in
that case we would have C 2(n1) = 3n1+1
4 < n1, which also has an unbounded sequence.)

Lemma 11. For all 1 ≤ i, we have
 T (ni) < 35
18 · 1
X0 or

T (ni) + T (ni+1) < 2 · 35
18 · 1
X0 .

Proof. Let ki be as in Deﬁnition 6. For ki ≤ 2 we have

T (ni) < 1
ni · (1 + 2
3
) = 5
3 · 1
ni < 35
18 · 1
ni < 35
18 · 1
X0 .

Now let ki ≥ 3. Then
 T (ni) =
 ki−1∑

t=0

C t(ni) <
 ki−1∑

t=0

ni ·
 (
3 − 3 · ( 2
3
)ki)

and C ki(ni) > ( 3
2)ki · ni. As an e-step follows, we get

C ki+1(ni) > 1
2 · ( 3
2 )ki · ni.

6

If C ki+1(ni) is already the next local minimum, that is ni+1 = C ki+1(ni), we get

T (ni+1) < 3
ni+1 < 6 · (2
3
 )ki · 1
ni ,

T (ni) + T (ni+1) < 1
ni ·

3 − 3 · ( 2

ni ·
 (
3 + 3 · (2

 )ki)

≤ 1
ni · 35
9 < 2 · 35
18 · 1
X0 .

The second-to-last inequality follows from ( 2
3)ki ≤ 8
27 for ki ≥ 3.
Finally, we must consider the case when there are at least two e-steps after the ki o-steps
following ni. Then from Lemma 9 we know that there exists an integer n
′
i = ni−1
2 for which
the Collatz sequence merges with that of ni, and thus with the considered cycle.
But n
′
i > X0 since for every positive integer less than or equal to X0 the Collatz sequence
enters the trivial cycle. Hence, we have ni > 2·n
′
i > 2X0 and thus T (ni) < 3
ni < 3
2· 1
X0 < 35
18 · 1
X0 ,
which concludes the proof.

Lemma 12. Let 0 ≤ m1 be an integer. Then

m1∑

i=1 T (ni) < 35m1 + 19
18 · 1
X0 .

Proof. We split the sum into single summands or sums of two consecutive summands, to
each of which we apply the previous lemma. From Lemma 11, we know that T (n1) < 35
18 · 1
X0
or T (n1) + T (n2) < 2 · 35
18 · 1
X0 . In the ﬁrst case, our ﬁrst part consists solely of T (n1). In
the second case, it is the partial sum T (n1) + T (n2). The second partial sum is deﬁned in a
similar way, and so on. We say such a partial sum is complete if from Lemma 11 we know
that it is smaller than 35
18 · 1
X0 for one summand or 2 · 35
18 · 1
X0 for two summands. Since all
such partial sums until the one with T (nm1−1) are complete, they therefore have an average
value of less than 35
18 · 1
X0 per summand. Thus, if T (nm1) is in a complete partial sum we get
∑m1
i=1 T (ni) < 35
18 · m1 · 1
X0 , and if T (nm1) is not part of a complete partial sum, it cannot be
in a partial sum together with T (nm1−1). Thus, we have

m1∑

i=1 T (ni) = T (nm1) +
 m1−1∑

i=1 T (ni) < T (nm1) + (m1 − 1) · 35
18 · 1
X0

< 3
X0 + (m1 − 1) · 35
18 · 1
X0 = 35m1 + 19
18 · 1
X0 ,

where we used the trivial bound T (nm1) < 3
X0 from Remark 7.
Note that this bound holds for all sums with m1 consecutive local minima.

A more detailed analysis in the proof of Lemma 11 yields a slightly better result:

Corollary 13. For all 1 ≤ i ≤ m we have
 T (ni) < 97
54 · 1
X0 ,

T (ni) + T (ni+1) < 2 · 97
54 · 1
X0 ,

or T (ni) + T (ni+1) + T (ni+2) < 3 · 97
54 · 1
X0 .

Proof. As in the proof of Lemma 11 let ki be the exact number of consecutive o-steps
after ni, and let ℓi be the exact number of consecutive e-steps thereafter. Then we have
C ki+ℓi(ni) = ni+1.
In the case of ki ≤ 2, we get T (ni) < 5
3 · 1
ni < 97
54 · 1
X0 , as with the proof of Lemma 11.
Similarly, in the case that ℓi ≥ 2, we get T (ni) < 3
2 · 1
X0 < 97
54 · 1
X0 . If ℓi = 1 and ki ≥ 4, we
have
 T (ni) + T (ni+1) < 1
ni ·
 (
3 + 3 · (2
3
 )ki)
 ≤ 1
ni · 97
27 < 2 · 97
54 · 1
X0 ,

where the second-to-last inequality follows from 3 + 3 · ( 2
3)ki ≤ 3 + 3 · 16
81 = 97
27 as ki ≥ 4.
Thus, the only case that requires closer analysis is ki = 3 and ℓi = 1. Then there exists a
nonnegative integer a with ni = a · 16 + 7 and ni+1 = 27 · a + 13. If ℓi+1 ≥ 2, then—as in the
proof of Lemma 11—there exists a nonnegative integer n
′
i+1 = ni+1−1
2 for which the Collatz
sequence merges with the one of ni+1 and therefore with the considered m-cycle. Thus, we
have n
′
i+1 ≥ X0 + 1 and subsequently a ≥ 2X0−10
27 and ni ≥ 32X0−160+189
27 > 32
27 · X0. That leads
to the following bounds:
 T (ni) < 1
ni · (
1 + 2
3 + 4
9
 ) = 1
ni · 19
9

< 1
32
27 · X0 · 19
9 = 57
32 · 1
X0 < 97
54 · 1
X0 .

Hence, the only remaining case is ki = 3 and ℓi = ℓi+1 = 1. As ki = 3 and ℓi = 1, we know
that T (ni) < 19
9 · 1
ni and ni+1 > 27
16 · ni and that therefore 1
ni+1 < 16
27 · 1
ni .
If ki+1 ≤ 2 we have
 T (ni+1) < 5
3 · 1
ni+1 < 80
81 · 1
ni < 1
ni ,

T (ni) + T (ni+1) < 28
9 · 1
ni < 2 · 97
54 · 1
X0 .

8

If ki+1 ≥ 3, from the proof of Lemma 11 we know

T (ni+1) + T (ni+2) < 1
ni+1 · 35
9 < 35
9 · 16
27 · 1
ni

= 560
243 · 1
ni ,

T (ni) + T (ni+1) + T (ni+2) < (19
9 + 560
243
) · 1
ni = 1073
243 · 1
ni

< 3 · 97
54 · 1
X0 .

With this, we also get a similar but slightly better result than with Lemma 12:

Theorem 14. Let 0 ≤ m1 be an integer. Then

m1∑

i=1 T (ni) < 97m1 + 73
54 · 1
X0 .

Proof. As in the proof of Lemma 12, we break the sum into parts of length one, two, or
three consecutive summands in the sense from Corollary 13. With exception of the last one
(in some cases), all of these partial sums are complete. So we know that these partial sums
are smaller than 97
54 · 1
X0 times the number of their respective summands.
If T (nm1) is part of such a complete partial sum, we have

m1∑

i=1 T (ni) < 97m1
54 · 1
X0 .

If T (nm1) is not part of such a complete partial sum but T (nm1−1) is, we have

m1∑

i=1 T (ni) < 97(m1 − 1)
54 · 1
X0 + 3
X0 = 97m1 + 65
54 · 1
X0 .

Here, we used the trivial bound T (nm1) < 3
X0 , as noted in Remark 7.
If neither T (nm1) nor T (nm1−1) are part of such a complete partial sum, we know that
the last complete partial sum ended with T (nm1−2). With this, and by applying Lemma 12
to the sum T (nm1−1) + T (nm1), we get

m1∑

i=1 T (ni) < 97(m1 − 2)
54 · 1
X0 + 89
18 · 1
X0 = 97m1 + 73
54 · 1
X0 .

3 On Collatz m-cycles

Deﬁnition 15. From now on, let δ := log(3)
log(2) > 1.

The following theorem and its proof are similar to the work done by Eliahou in [3].

Theorem 16. Let K be the number of odd numbers in a given m-cycle and L be the number
of even numbers in it. Further let ki, ni and T (ni) be as in Deﬁnition 6. Then,

δ < K + L
K < δ + 1
K · 3 · log(2) ·

i=1 T (ni).

Proof. Let Ω be the set of numbers in the m-cycle, Ωo the subset of odd numbers and Ωe
the subset of even numbers. Then we have |Ωo| = K, |Ωe| = L, and (due to cyclicity)

The right-hand side is obviously larger than ∏

n∈Ωo 3 = 3K; however, because of the
inequality between arithmetic and geometric mean, it is also smaller than

∏

where µ is µ := 1
K · ∑

3K < 2K+L ≤ (3 + µ)K,
K · log(3) < (K + L) · log(2) ≤ K · log(3 + µ)

= K · (log(3) + log (1 + µ

δ = log(3)

K < log(3)

Now let us rewrite µ:
 µ = 1
K · ∑

i=1

t=0

C t(ni) ,

where ki is the exact number of consecutive o-steps after ni to the next local maximum on
the cycle. Thus, we have ∑m
i=1 ki = K, as every such step follows an odd number on the
cycle. The inner sum is T (ni) as deﬁned in the theorem. Hence, we get

µ = 1
K ·
 m∑

i=1 T (ni),

δ < K + L
K < δ + 1
K · 3 · log(2) ·
 m∑

i=1 T (ni).

This leads to the following result:

Corollary 17. With K, L as in Theorem 16, we have

δ < K + L
K < δ + 1
K · 3 log(2) · 97
54 · m · 1
X0 .

Proof. From Theorem 16 we know

δ < K + L
K < δ + 1
K · 3 · log(2) ·
 m∑

i=1 T (ni).

Thus, we need to prove ∑m
i=1 T (ni) < 97
54 · m · 1
X0 . To do so, let t be an arbitrarily large
integer and remember that we set nm+1 := n1, nm+2 := n2, and so on. With m1 := t · m and
using Theorem 14, we get

t ·
 m∑

i=1 T (ni) =
 t·m∑

i=1 T (ni) < 97(t · m) + 73

X0 ,

m∑

i=1 T (ni) < 97
54 · m · 1

t · 73
54 · 1
X0 .

As one can choose t as large as needed, the second summand can be lessened to ε for every
ε > 0. Thus, we have

m∑

i=1 T (ni) < 97
54 · m · 1
X0 + ε for every ε > 0 and, therefore,

m∑

i=1 T (ni) ≤ 97
54 · m · 1
X0 ,

which proves the claim.

Remark 18. Since 1
3 · 97
54 ≈ 0.599, this is an improvement of more than 40% over Corollary 5
of Simons and de Weger in [12].
Using a computer program and the known results for X0, we get a stronger result:

Corollary 19. Provided that X0 ≥ 704 · 260, we have

δ < K + L
K < δ + 1
K · 3 log(2) · m · 1
704 · 260 .

Proof. In Lemma 11 and Corollary 13, we proved that the average summand in a complete
partial sum ∑

i T (ni) is smaller than a constant times 1
X0 . We obtained the best value for
this constant in Corollary 13 with 97
54 . To achieve this result, we had to consider partial sums
of up to three consecutive summands in this sum.
If we want to get even lower bounds for this constant, we have two possible options:
First, we can increase the number of considered consecutive summands T (ni) in a partial
sum. But this increases also the amount of work necessary in the case-by-case analysis. A
second possibility is to use the exact known value of X0 instead of using it as a parameter.
This signiﬁcantly reduces the number of cases to be considered.
Providing that X0 > 704 · 260 we want to prove that the average T (ni) is smaller than
1
704·260 . To do so, we apply the same methods as above to get upper bounds of the form c · 1
ni
for sums of T (ni) for consecutive local minima ni. But if r is the smallest positive integer
with r ≡ ni (mod 2k) for some value of k (the number of, for this case, “ﬁxed” steps in the
Collatz sequence after ni), we clearly have ni ≥ r. If r is large enough, the calculated bound
falls below the value of 1
704·260 . Then we can mark this case as proven.
Since this kind of proof gets very lengthy, we automated this process by writing a small
program in C++. It considers partial sums with up to 60 consecutive summands T (ni).
Having used the program to prove this property, we can proceed as we did in the proof
of Corollary 17 and obtain the desired result.

The following lemma also can be found in [12].

Lemma 20. Let ni, ni+1 be two successive local minima in an m-cycle. Then we have
ni+1 < n
δ
i .

Proof. Let ki be the exact number of consecutive o-steps after ni until the next local max-
imum in the cycle. By Lemma 8 and its proof, we know that there is a positive integer a
with ni = a · 2ki − 1 and C ki(ni) = a · 3ki − 1. Since ki is the exact number of consecutive
such steps after ni, we know that C ki(ni) has to be even. Therefore, we know that ni+1, the
next odd number, fulﬁlls the inequality ni+1 ≤ 1
2 · C ki(ni). Thus, we get

ni+1 ≤ 1
2 · C ki(ni) = 1
2 · (a · 3ki − 1) < 3ki

2 · a = 3ki

2 · ni + 1
2ki

= (2ki)δ−1 · 1

12

Note that the statement is also true for i = m and nm+1 := n1.

Theorem 21. Let K be the number of odd numbers in a given m-cycle, and let L be the
number of even numbers in it. Further, assume there exists a positive integer m2 with

m2 ≤ m and δm2 − 1
δ − 1 · log ( 162
97 · X0)

log(2) ≤ m2
m · K.

Let v = m2
m · K · δ−1
δm2 −1. Then we get

δ < K + L
K < δ + 1
K · 3 log(2) · (97(m − m2) + 73
54 · X0 + 3
2v − 1 + 3 · (m2 − 1)
(2v − 1)δ
 ) .

If m2 = m − 1 we get the better estimate

δ < K + L
K < δ + 1
K · 3 log(2) · ( 3
X0 + 3
2v − 1 + 3 · (m − 2)
(2v − 1)δ
 )

and for m2 = m
 δ < K + L
K < δ + 1
K · 3 log(2) · ( 3
2v − 1 + 3 · (m − 1)
(2v − 1)δ
 ) .

Proof. First, let m2 be as given in this theorem. If the only nonnegative integer fulﬁlling the
given inequality is m2 = 0, Corollary 17 and Corollary 19 give good upper bounds for K+L
K .
Now let the inequality be true for some integer m2 > 0.
From Theorem 16, we know

δ < K + L
K < δ + 1
K · 3 · log(2) ·
 m∑

i=1 T (ni).

Therefore, we have to give upper bounds on ∑m
i=1 T (ni) in the diﬀerent cases. To do so, we
use Theorem 14 and Lemma 20:
There are m2 consecutive local minima which are directly followed by at least m2
m · K o-
steps in total. (If this would not be the case, all of the sums k1 +· · ·+km2, k2 +· · ·+km2+1, . . .
and km+k1+· · ·+km2−1 would be smaller than m2
m ·K. But adding these m sums together gives
m2 · K, as every ki occurs in exactly m2 such sums and ∑m
i=1 ki = K, which contradicts the
assumption.) W.l.o.g., let these m2 consecutive local minima be nm−m2+1, nm−m2+2, . . . , nm.
From Lemma 8 we know that ki ≤ log(ni+1)
log(2) . Now Lemma 20 gives ni+1 < n
δ
i and,

therefore, ni+1 + 1 < n
δ
i + 1 < (ni + 1)δ which leads to the inequality ki+1 < δ · log(ni+1)
log(2) .

Subsequently, in an analogous way we get ki+ℓ < δℓ · log(ni+1)
log(2) .

13

Now we can sum up these estimates for i = m − m2 + 1, . . . , m:

m2
m · K ≤
 m∑

i=m−m2+1 ki =
 m2−1∑

ℓ=0 k(m−m2+1)+ℓ

≤ log(nm−m2+1 + 1)
log(2) ·
 m2−1∑

ℓ=0 δℓ

= log(nm−m2+1 + 1)
log(2) · δm2 − 1
δ − 1 .

From the premise on m2, we know that this is larger than

δm2 − 1
δ − 1 · log ( 162
97 · X0)

log(2) .

Thus, we get
 nm−m2+1 + 1 > 162
97 · X0 and, therefore, nm−m2+1 ≥ 162
97 · X0.

Now with Remark 7 we conclude T (nm−m2+1) < 3
nm−m2 +1 < 97
54 · 1
X0 . Thus, this estimate
on T (nm−m2+1) is at least as good as the one we get from Theorem 14. But we can get a
better one:
From the deﬁnition of v, we get v · δm2 −1
δ−1 = m2
m · K. Thus, we have

v ≤ log(nm−m2+1 + 1)
log(2) or, equivalently, 2v − 1 ≤ nm−m2+1.

Now this gives T (nm−m2+1) < 3
2v−1 and, since

nm−m2+1+ℓ < n
(δℓ)
m−m2+1 ≤ n
δ
m−m2+1,

we get the inequality T (nm−m2+1+ℓ) < 3
(2v −1)δ . Using this together with Theorem 14 and
m1 := m − m2, we get

m∑

i=1 T (ni) =
 m−m2∑

i=1 T (ni) + T (nm−m2+1) +
 m∑

i=m−m2+1+1 T (ni)

< 97(m − m2) + 1
54 · X0 + 3
2v − 1 + 3 · (m2 − 1)
(2v − 1)δ ,

which proves the general statement for 1 ≤ m2 ≤ m. For m2 = m − 1, the ﬁrst sum∑m−m2
i=1 T (ni) = T (n1) can be better bounded above by 3
X0 , as seen in Remark 7. For
m2 = m, this ﬁrst sum is empty and therefore zero.

14

We now give a well known lemma for diophantine approximation:

Lemma 22. Let 0 < α < β be two real numbers with continued fraction expansions α =
[a0; a1, . . . , ak−1, ak, . . .] and β = [a0; a1, . . . , ak−1, bk, . . .]. Then every fraction in the open in-
terval (α, β) has a denominator which is not smaller than the one of γ = [a0; a1, . . . , ak−1, ck]
with ck = min(ak, bk) + 1.

Proof. First, let γ be some real number with α < γ < β. Since ⌊α⌋ = a0 = ⌊β⌋, we also have
⌊γ⌋ = a0. Thus, 0 < α − a0 < γ − a0 < β − a0 < 1 and, therefore, 1 < 1
β−a0 < 1
γ−a0 < 1
α−a0 .

Since ⌊ 1
β−a0
 ⌋ = a1 = ⌊ 1
α−a0
 ⌋
, we also get ⌊ 1
γ−a0
 ⌋ = a1, and so on.
Thus, for every real number γ within the interval (α, β), we get the same beginning in
the continued fraction expansion of γ: γ = [a0; a1, . . . , ak−1, . . .].
If k is even, increasing the partial denominator increases the fraction. Thus, we have
ak < bk and [a0; a1, . . . , ak−1, ak] < α < [a0; a1, . . . , ak−1, ak + 1] < β.

If we choose ck := ak + 1 = min(ak + bk) + 1, we get the fraction with smallest denominator
in this interval.
If k is odd, decreasing the partial denominator increases the fraction. Thus, we have
ak > bk and α < [a0; a1, . . . , ak−1, bk + 1] < β < [a0; a1, . . . , ak−1, bk].

If we choose ck := bk + 1 = min(ak + bk) + 1, we get the fraction with smallest denominator
in this interval.

Theorem 23 (Main Theorem). There is no m-cycle with m ≤ 91.

Proof. Let m ≤ 91. From Theorem 3 in [12] we know that K > 7 · 1011.
With X0 = 704 · 260 ≈ 8.1 · 1020, as given in Deﬁnition 4, we get m2 ≥ 47. Now, from
Theorem 21 we have δ < K + L
K < δ + 6.9 · 10−32.

By using continued fractions as in Lemma 22, we can now get a better lower bound for K
with K > 5.2 · 1015.

And now we can reiterate this process!
In the next run, we get m2 ≥ 67, δ < K+L
K < δ + 5.1 · 10−36 and, therefore, K > 3.97 · 1017.
Applying this newer bound on K once more, we get m2 ≥ 77,
δ < K+L
K < δ + 4.1 · 10−38 and, hence, K > 4.64 · 1018.
In the forth run we get m2 ≥ 82, δ < K+L
K < δ + 2.3 · 10−39 and with this K > 2.74 · 1019.
From there we get m2 ≥ 86, δ < K+L
K < δ + 2.3 · 10−40 and K > 7.76 · 1019. And from this
we get m2 ≥ 88, δ < K+L
K < δ + 5.3 · 10−41 and K > 2.05 · 1020.
Applying this lower bounnd a last time we get m2 ≥ 91, δ < K+L
K < δ + 1.11 · 10−43 and
K > 7.94 · 1021.
 15

But this last lower bound on K is larger than the upper bound of K < 1.4784mδm <
2.2 · 1020 given by Simons and de Weger [12]. Thus, no such m-cycle can exist.

Using the same technique as above and Corollaries 17 and 19, we also get new lower
bounds on K for m-cycles with m ≥ 92:

Corollary 24. In Table 1 diﬀerent pairs of values m und K are listed. If there is a m-cycle
with m equal or smaller than the given value, this cycle consists of at least the corresponding
number of K odd members.

For all m ∈ N 7.20 · 1010

Table 1: Corollary 24: If m ≤ · · · , then K > · · · .

Proof. The ﬁrst two lines follow from Theorem 21, all others except the last one from Corol-
lary 19, and the last one from the statement independent of m in [4, 9] or [3], using the
known value of X0 as in Deﬁnition 4 and given in [2].

Remark 25. Over time, with better known lower limits on X0, one gets slightly better results
in Corollary 24. The results in this corollary are in some cases signiﬁcant improvements on
the bounds given by Theorem 3 in [12].

4 Cycles without knowing m

In a manner similar to that in Lemma 11 and Corollary 13, we want to give an upper bound
on another weighted average of the T (ni):
 16

Lemma 26. For all 1 ≤ i, we have
 T (ni) < ki · 3
4 · 1
X0 ,

T (ni) + T (ni+1) < (ki + ki+1) · 3
4 · 1
X0 ,

or T (ni) + T (ni+1) + T (ni+2) < (ki + ki+1 + ki+2) · 3
4 · 1
X0 .

Proof. As in the proofs of Lemma 11 and Corollary 13, let ki be the exact number of o-
steps following ni and ℓi the exact number of e-steps following them, such that we have
ni+1 = C ki+ℓi(ni).
If ki = 1, there exists a nonnegative integer a with ni = 4·a+1 such that C 2(ni) = 3·a+1.
Since C 2(ni) ≥ X0 + 1, we have ni ≥ 4
3 · X0 + 1 > 4
3 · X0 and, therefore, T (ni) < 3
4 · 1
X0 .
If ki = 3 ,we know T (ni) < 19
9 · 1
X0 < 3 · 3
4 · 1
X0 .
If ki ≥ 4, we have T (ni) < 3 · 1
X0 ≤ ki · 3
4 · 1
X0 .
This only leaves the case ki = 2 for further investigation. There we have T (ni) = 5
3 · 1
ni . If
ℓi ≥ 2, we know from the cited proofs that ni > 2X0 and, therefore, T (ni) < 5
6 · 1
X0 < 2· 3
4 · 1
X0 .
Thus, let ki = 2 and ℓi = 1. Then there exists a nonnegative integer a with ni = 8 · a + 3
and ni+1 = 9 · a + 4. If ki+1 = 1, we have ni+1 ≥ 4
3 · X0 + 1 and ni ≥ 32
27 · X0 + 1
3 > 32
27 · X0.
With this, we get
 T (ni) < 5
3 · 27
32 · 1
X0 = 45
32 · 1
X0 < 2 · 3
4 · 1
X0 .

In the case ki = 2 and ℓi = 1 we generally have ni+1 > 9
8 · ni. Thus, if ki+1 ≥ 5, we get

T (ni) + T (ni+1) < ( 5
3 + 3 · 9
8
 ) · 1
X0 = 121
24 · 1
X0

< 7 · 3
4 · 1
X0 ≤ (ki + ki+1) · 3
4 · 1
X0 .

If ki = 2, ℓi = 1 and ki+1 = 4, with the better estimate T (ni+1) < 65
27 · 1
ni+1 the following
inequality holds:
 T (ni) + T (ni+1) < ( 5
3 + 65
27 · 9
8
 ) · 1
X0 = 105
24 · 1
X0

< 6 · 3
4 · 1
X0 = (ki + ki+1) · 3
4 · 1
X0 .

This leaves ki = 2, ℓi = 2 and ki+1 ∈ {2, 3}. If ℓi+1 ≥ 2, we have ni+1 > 2X0 as above
and, therefore, ni+1 ≥ 2X0 + 1 and, hence, ni = 8
9 · ni+1 − 5
9 > 16
9 · X0. With this, we get

T (ni) < 5
3 · 9
16 · 1
X0 < 2 · 3
4 · 1
X0 .

17

Therefore, from now on we can assume ℓi+1 = 1. Let ki = 2, ℓi = 1 and in this case
ki+1 = 2. Then there exists a nonnegative integer a with ni = 26 · a + 59 and C 2+1+2+1(ni) =
ni+2 = 34 · a + 76. Moreover, we have

T (ni) + T (ni+1) < 5
3 · 1
ni + 5
3 · 1
ni+1 < 5
3 · 1
ni + 5
3 · 8
9 · 1
ni = 85
27 · 1
ni .

If ki = 2, ℓi = 1, ki+1 = 2, ℓi+1 = 1 and ki+2 = 1, we get ni+2 ≥ 4
3 · X0 + 1 and, therefore,
ni > 256
243 · X0 − 1. Hence,

T (ni) + T (ni+1) < 85
27 · ni + 1
ni · 1
ni + 1

< 85
27 · 243
256 · ni + 1

X0

= 765
256 · ni + 1
ni · 1
X0

< 765
256 · 766
765 · 1
X0 (as ni > X0 > 765)

< 766
256 · 1
X0 < 4 · 3
4 · 1
X0 .

If ki+2 = 2, we get
 T (ni+2) = 5
3 · 1
ni+2 < 5
3 · 64
81 · 1
X0 = 320
243 · 1
X0

and, thus,
 T (ni) + T (ni+1) + T (ni+2) < ( 85
27 + 320
243
 ) · 1
X0 = 1085
243 · 1
X0

< 6 · 3
4 · 1
X0 = (ki + ki+1 + ki+2) · 3
4 · 1
X0 .

In the same way, for ki+2 = 3 we get T (ni+2) < 19
9 · 64
81 · 1
X0 = 1216
729 · 1
X0 and

T (ni) + T (ni+1) + T (ni+2) < ( 85
27 + 1216
729
 ) · 1
X0 = 3511
729 · 1
X0

< 7 · 3
4 · 1
X0 = (ki + ki+1 + ki+2) · 3
4 · 1
X0 .

For ki+2 ≥ 4 we have T (ni+2) < 3 · 64
81 · 1
X0 = 64
27 · 1
X0 . Thus,

T (ni) + T (ni+1) + T (ni+2) < ( 85
27 + 64
27
 ) · 1
X0 = 149
27 · 1
X0

< 8 · 3
4 · 1
X0 = (ki + ki+1 + ki+2) · 3
4 · 1
X0 ,

18

which concludes the proof in the case ki = 2, ℓi = 1, ki+1 = 2 and ℓi+1 = 1.
Now we only need to consider the case ki = 2, ℓi = 1, ki+1 = 3 and ℓi+1 = 1. Here, there
exists a nonnegative integer a with ni = 27 · a + 91 and C 2+1+3+1(ni) = ni+2 = 35 · a + 175.
We also have

T (ni) + T (ni+1) < 5
3 · 1
ni + 19
9 · 1
ni+1 < 5
3 · 1
ni + 19
9 · 8
9 · 1
ni = 297
81 · 1
ni .

If ki+2 = 1, we have T (ni+2) = 1
ni+2 < 128
243 · 1
ni and, therefore,

T (ni) + T (ni+1) + T (ni+1) < (297

) · 1
X0

= 1019
243 · 1
X0 < 6 · 3
4 · 1
X0

= (ki + ki+1 + ki+2) · 3
4 · 1
X0 .

At last, if ki+2 ≥ 2 we have T (ni+2) < 3
ni+2 < 128
81 · 1
ni , and with this, we get

T (ni) + T (ni+1) + T (ni+1) < (297

81
 ) · 1
X0

= 425
81 · 1
X0 < 7 · 3
4 · 1
X0

≤ (ki + ki+1 + ki+2) · 3

X0 ,

which concludes the last open case and, therefore, the proof.

This leads to a result similar to that yielded by the Main Theorem 21, but independent
of the number m of local minima in the nontrivial cycle:

Theorem 27. Let K be the number of odd numbers in a given m-cycle, and let L be the
number of even numbers in it. Then

δ < K + L
K < δ + 1
3 log(2) · 3
4 · 1
X0 .

Proof. As in the proof of Theorem 21, the only thing we have to do is proving the inequality

m∑

i=1 T (ni) ≤ K · 3
4 · 1
X0 .

To do so, we proceed as we did in the proofs of Theorem 14 and Corollary 17. First, let m1
be a positive integer and consider the sum

m1∑

i=1 T (ni).

19

We break this sum into partial sums consisting of one, two, or three consecutive summands.
We can do this in such a way that for all partial sums (with the possible exception of the
last) we know by Lemma 26 that each of these is smaller than k · 3
4 · 1
X0 , where k is the number
of o-steps in the at most three consecutive strictly increasing parts of the given nontrivial
cycle. The last partial sum consists of at most two summands. Using the trivial bounds
T (nm1−1) < 3 · 1
X0 and T (nm1) < 3 · 1
X0 , we get

m1∑

i=1 T (ni) <
 ( m1∑

i=1 ki
)
 · 3
4 · 1
X0 + 2 · 3 · 1
X0

=
 ( m1∑

i=1 ki + 8
)
 · 3
4 · 1
X0 .

Now, let t be an arbitrarily large integer and m1 = t · m. Then we get

t ·
 m∑

i=1 T (ni) =
 t·m∑

i=1 T (ni) <
 ( t·m∑

i=1 ki + 8
)
 · 3
4 · 1
X0

= (t · K + 8) · 3
4 · 1
X0 , where we used
 t·m∑

i=1 ki = t ·
 m∑

i=1 ki = t · K.

This leads directly to

m∑

i=1 T (ni) < K · 3
4 · 1
X0 + ε for all ε > 0 and, therefore,

m∑

i=1 T (ni) ≤ K · 3
4 · 1
X0 as desired.

Remark 28. Theorem 27 leads to a reduction of the bounds on X0 given in or computed by
the methods in [3], which are needed for reaching the next threshold on K in a nontrivial
cycle, by 25%. Thus, to prove that every nontrivial cycle contains at least K > 1.375 · 1011

odd numbers, using previous methods one would have to show δ < K+L
K < δ + 1.1032 · 10−22,
and therefore, X0 ≥ 3781 · 260. With the result given in Theorem 27, it suﬃces to show
X0 ≥ 2836 · 260.

If one is interested in the problem of lowering the value for X0 given in the last remark
to the greatest extend possible, one can use the methods of Lemma 26 in an automated way.

Corollary 29. If X0 ≥ 1536 · 260 = 3 · 269 then every nontrivial cycle contains at least
K > 1.375 · 1011 odd numbers.
 20

Proof. We have written a small C++ program, which mainly uses the methods given in the
proof of Lemma 26. There is one key exception: for every situation, the program tracks the
residue classes modulo powers of two for a given number ni. If the smallest positive member
of this residue class is already larger than the needed bound of 3781 · 260, this case no longer
needs to be considered, since then one can use the trivial bound T (ni) ≤ ki
ni < ki · 1
3781·260 .
This bound on X0 was reached after ﬁve weeks of computing time on an i9 processor of
the 11th generation with 8 cores.

Remark 30. If one wants to prove that every nontrivial cycle has at least K > 1.375·1011 odd
members with Corollary 29 it suﬃces to proof for all numbers less than or equal to 1536 · 260

that their respective Collatz sequences reach the trivial cycle. This bound on X0 is only
about 40% of the one needed by the methods in [3], thus saving nearly 60% of computing
time requierd to reach the next threshold for the next larger lower bound on the number of
members a nontrivial Collatz cycle must have. As the current fastest project for increasing
X0, see [2], needed over 27 months for completing the search up to 512 · 260 = 269, this
reduction has some impact.
In our numerical experiments, we get that by lowering the bound on X0 by 260 (that is,
e.g., from 1536 · 260 to 1535 · 260) the computing time needed increases by about 1.5%. Thus,
the chosen bound of X0 in Corollary 29 cannot be decreased by a reasonable amount before
this computation becomes less eﬀective than the search in [2].

Remark 31. All results in this paper, with the exception of Corollaries 19, 24, and 29, are
independent of the exact value of X0, provided it is not too small. (In all other lemmas,
theorems, and corollaries we needed at most X0 > 765.) Thus, they scale up and give better
absolute values, as better results on X0 become available.
