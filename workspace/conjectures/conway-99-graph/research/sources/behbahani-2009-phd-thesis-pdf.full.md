Abstract

On strongly regular graphs

Majid Behbahani, Ph.D.

Concordia University, 2009

Strongly regular graphs are regular graphs with the additional property that the

number of common neighbours for two vertices depends only on whether the vertices

are adjacent or non-adjacent.

From an algebraic point of view, a graph is strongly regular if its adjacency matrix

has exactly three eigenvalues. Strongly regular graphs have very interesting algebraic

properties due to their strong regularity conditions.

Many strongly regular graphs are known to have large and interesting automor-

phism groups [23]. In [23] it is also conjectured that almost all strongly regular graphs

are asymmetric. Peter Cameron in [7] mentions that "Strongly regular graphs lie on

the cusp between highly structured and unstructured."

Although strongly regular graphs have been studied extensively since they were

introduced, there is very little known about the automorphism group of an arbitrary

strongly regular graph based on its parameters.

In this thesis, we have developed theory for studying the automorphisms of strongly

regular graphs. Our study is both mathematical and computational. On the com-

putational side, we introduce the notion of orbit matrices. Using these matrices, we

were able to show that some strongly regular graphs do not admit an automorphism

of a certain order.

Given the size of the automorphism, we can generate all of the orbit mat rices, using

a computer program. Another computer program is implemented that generates all

the strongly regular graphs from that orbit matrix.

From a mathematical point of view, we have found an upper bound on the number

of fixed points of the automorphisms of a strongly regular graph. This upper bound

is a new upper bound and is obtained by algebraic techniques.

Chapter 1

Introduction and statement of the

problem

In this chapter, we summarise the basic definitions and theorems about strongly

regular graphs and partial geometries that we are using in the thesis. Some examples

are provided for a better understanding of the theory.

1.1 Organisation of the thesis

In this thesis, we study the existence of strongly regular graphs and their automor-

phisms. For this purpose, we developed a computer program called the SRG program.

Given an automorphism of prime order and the parameters of a strongly regular graph,

the SRG program is able to tell us whether or not there is a strongly regular graph

with those parameters having the given automorphism.

Strongly regular graphs have many interesting algebraic and combinatorial prop-

erties. We study the properties of strongly regular graphs in Chapter 2.

The SRG program uses the concept of orbit matrices for the generation of strongly

regular graphs. In Chapter 3, we will see how orbit matrices can be generated for

strongly regular graphs.

In Chapter 4. we will show how the computer program, we developed for finding

1

strongly regular graphs, works. In this chapter, we will also show the results we

obtained by running this computer program.

In chapter 5, we will show how the orbit matrices can be obtained for partial

geometries. We also show how partial geometries can be generated by a computer

program.

The conclusion and future work can be found in Chapter 6.

1.2 Basic definition of a strongly regular graph

and an example

We start by defining the concept of a graph.

Definition 1.1 An undirected graph G consists of a set of vertices V(G): together

with a set of edges E(G) where an edge is an un-ordered pair of vertices.

In this thesis, the vertex set is usually the set {1,2, ...,y} . Please note that we

sometimes use uv or (u, u), to represent an edge {u.v}. Two vertices u and v are

adjacent, if {u, ?;} € E. and u is a neighbour of v, and vice versa. Since every graph

in this thesis in undirected, we shall generally omit the adjective "undirected". The

number of neighbours of a vertex x is called the degree of .x. A graph is called regular

if all its vertices have the same degree. The minimum degree of a graph G\ denoted

5(G), is the minimum degree of all the vertices of G. The adjacency matrix B of a

graph G(V, E) is the | V| x |V| matrix such that

A subgraph of a graph G is a graph H such that V{H) C V{G) and E{H) C E{G).

A vertex induced subgraph of a graph G is a subset X of vertices of G, along with

all edges that have both their endpoints in X. An edge indvced subgraph of a graph

G is a subset Y of edges of G along with all vertices that are endpoints of the edges

in Y.
 0 otherwise.

Definition 1.2 A strongly regular graph svg(v, k, A. /i) is a graph with v vertices such

that the number of common neighbours of x and y is k, X, or n according to whether

x and y are equal, adjacent, or non-adjacent, respectively.

Example 1. Matrix B defined below is the adjacency matrix of the Petersen graph.

0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1

0  0  0  0  1  1  0  0  0  1

0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  0  0

0  0  0  0  1  0  1  0  1  0

0  1  0  1  0  0  0  1  0  0

0  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  1  0

0  0  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  1

1  0  1  0  1  0  0  0  0  0

1  0  0  1  0  1  0  0  0  0

1  1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0

One can verify that the Petersen graph is an srg(10, 3,0.1) by counting for each

edge, {u, i'}, the number of common neighbours of u and v. For example, {1,2} ^ E

and the vertex 10 is the only common neighbour of 1 and 2, which agrees with the

assertion that //, = 1.

One can see that by simultaneously cyclically permuting the rows and columns

in these groups, group 1 being {2,3,4}, group 2 being {5,6,7}, and group 3 being

{8, 9,10}, the matrix B is unchanged.

One can also see that the matrix B is subdivided into 9, 3 x 3 cyclic submatrices

and one fixed row (column). This is a result of an automorphism of order 3 Avith

1 fixed point. We use the idea of automorphisms in order to reduce the size of the

search in the SRG program. The search space is smaller if we know the whole matrix

can be divided into cyclic submatrices. •

1.3 Partial geometries and strongly regular graphs

Partial geometries are point-line structures. A point-line structure is a triple S = (V, £, I)

where V is a set of points, £ is a set of lines, and I C (V x £ ) U (£ x V) is a sym-

metric incidence relation. The elements of I are also called flags. If (P, /) 6 / , we say

that the point P is on the line I or P and I are incident.

If S is a point-line structure, <S*, the dual of S, is a point-line structure such that

the points (lines) of S* are the lines (points) of S. Two elements are incident in S*

if and only if they are incident in S.

The incidence matrix A of a point-line structure is defined as follows:

Definition 1.3 A partial linear space pls(,s, t) is a point-line structure such that:

(a) any line is incident with 5 + 1 points, and any point with t + 1 lines:

(b) two lines are incident with at most one point (and two points with at most one

line);

If two lines are incident with a point they are called concurrent. If two points are

incident with a line they are called collinear.

Definition 1.4 A partial geometry pg(s, t, a) is a pis(s,t) such that for every point

P not incident with a line I. exactly a lines on P are concurrent with I.

Example 2. The following example is the incidence matrix of a pg(2,2,1).

The column sum in this example corresponds to the number of points on a line,

which is s+ 1 = 3. The row sum corresponds to the number of lines incident on a point,

which is 3 since t = 2. To check that it is a partial geometry, we need to verify the

Q—condition stated in Definition 1.4 for every point-line pair (P, I) ^ I. For example,

we take P = P\ and I — I2- The set of lines incident with is {i1: Z3,1-, 1$, Z10, £12}-

From this set., only l\ is incident, with P\. The o condition can be checked similarly

for the rest of the point-line pairs. •

Partial geometries and strongly regular graphs are related because the existence

of a partial geometry implies the existence of two strongly regular graphs.

The point graph of a point-line structure S, denoted by r(<S). is a graph where the

vertices are the points of S. and where two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding

points in S are collinear.

For example, the matrix B defined as follows:

is the point graph of the partial geometry pg(2. 2,1), shown in Example 2. It is a

strongly regular graph with parameters v = 15, k = 6. A = 1, fi = 2.

Another strongly regular graph besides the point graph can be obtained from a

partial geometry. The line graph of a point-line structure S is a graph where the

vertices are the lines of S, and where two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding

lines in S are concurrent. The line graph of a partial geometry is also strongly

regular because it is the point graph of its dual.

1.4 Status of existence of strongly regular graphs

and partial geometries

1.4.1 Status of existence of strongly regular graphs

One of the most important problems about strongly regular graphs is their existence.

While many classes of strongly regular graphs are constructed, and there are some

non-existence results, for many parameter sets the existence of a strongly regular

graph is still unknown.

The first parameter set, for which we are not aware of the existence of the strongly

regular graph, is v = 65, k = 32, A = 15, fx = 16.

The following table extracted from the CRC-handbook of combinatorial designs

[10] shows the parameters of strongly regular graphs, with 100 or fewer vertices,

whose existence are unknown. Since the complement of a strongly regular graph is

V  k  A

Table 1: Unknown strongly regular graphs with small parameters

also strongly regular (Lemma 2.3). Table 1 contains only the parameter sets with

k < v/2.

Our main objective within this thesis is to determine whether these unknown

strongly regular graphs exist, if the order of a non-trivial automorphism is given.

1.4.2 Status of existence of partial geometries

Because of the relationship between partial geometries and strongly regular graphs,

one secondary objective is to investigate the possible existence of the unknown partial

geometries. An extensive amount of work has been done on the existence of partial

geometries. Table 2, obtained from the CRC-handbook of combinatorial designs [10],

shows the existence and non-existence of partial geometries with small parameters.

It also shows the parameters of the associated point and lines graphs.

Table 2: Partial geometries with small parameters

In Table 2, the column "Num." gives the exact number of non-isomorphic partial

geometries, or the specific strongly regular graph if the number is known. Otherwise.

8

a "+" denotes that one or more combinatorial object is known, and a "?" denotes

that its existence is unknown.

The number with the associated point or line graph is the number of strongly

regular graphs with the specified parameters, but they may not be the actual point

or line graph of a partial geometry.

We note that for some unknown partial geometries, for example pg(6,6,4) and

pg(6,10, 5), candidates for their point and line graphs exist. For other cases, even the

existence of candidate point and line graphs are also unknown.

1.5 Contributions

In this thesis, we developed the theory of orbit matrices for strongly regular graphs.

The theory gives an efficient method to test the existence of a strongly regular graph

when given an automorphism of prime order. This method, implemented using a

computer program, allows us to eliminate many primes as possible divisors of the order

of the automorphism group of the unknown strongly regular graphs. The remaining

viable prime divisors are given in Table 3.

While testing the program, we have also found some new strongly regular graphs

with parameters v = 49. k — 18. A = 7, // = 6, that are not isomorphic to the known

srg(49,18, 7,6). In addition, we have found some new upper bounds on the number

of fixed points that an automorphism of a strongly regular graph may have.

We have also generalised the theory of orbit matrices to partial geometries. As

future work, a computer program can be written to expand the orbit matrix to a

partial geometry.

Theorem 1.5 (Paduchick [40]) If G = srg(85,14, 3, 2), p is an automorphism of

G of prime order p. and A is the subgraph induced by the fixed points of p, then one

of the following is true:

(1) p = 5 or p = 17 and A is the empty graph;

(2) p —7 and A is a 1-clique or p = 5 and A is a 5-clique;

(3) p = 3. A is a quadrangle or a 2 x 5 lattice, and in the last case the neighbourhoods

of six vertices of A contain exactly two maximal cliques;

(4) p = 2. the neighbourhood of any vertex of A is connected. A is a union of x

isolated vertices and y isolated triangles, and either y = 1 and x {4, 6} or

y = 0 and x = 5.

The proof of Theorem 1.5 is based on the character theory of the Bose-Mesner algebra

of the graph.

One of the results of this thesis, as seen in Table 13, is that, the only possible

prime divisor of the size of the automorphism group of srg(85,14.3, 2) is 2, which

implies the items 1 to 3 of Theorem 1.5 are not possible.

In [35], Makhnev and Minakova, by using the same technique have shown that:

Theorem 1.6 (Makhnev, Minakova [35] ) If G = srg(99,14.1,2). p is an auto-

morphism of G of prime order p. and A is the subgraph induced by the fixed points of

p. then one of the following is true:

(1) A is the singleton graph and p equals 2 or 7:

(2) A is the empty graph and p equals 3 or 11:

(3) A is the triangle graph and p = 3.

One of the results of this thesis, as seen in Table 21, is that, the only possible prime

divisors of the size of the automorphism group of srg(85,14,3, 2) are 2 and 3. Moreover

if p = 3. then there are no fixed points.

Chapter 2

Introduction to strongly regular

graphs

2.1 Basic concepts

In 1963. Bose [2] introduced strongly regular graphs and partial geometries. A com-

prehensive survey about the construction, uniqueness, non-existence and necessary

conditions for partial geometries and strongly regular graphs is given by Brouwer and

van Lint [3]. We shall introduce the basic properties in this section.

The following theorem shows the relationship of the parameters of a strongly

regular graph.

Theorem 2.1 If G is an svg(v. k, A, //). then k(k — A - 1) = i_t(v — k — 1).

Proof To show the above equality, we count, in two different ways, the number of

edges {y, z} where y G N(x) and 2 ^ N(x).

First fix point .r and choose 2. We have v — k — 1 possibilities for since 2 ^ N(.r)

and 2 x. Now. we calculate all the possible choices for y. Any vertex that is

adjacent to both x and 2 is a candidate for y therefore, by Definition 1.2. there are //

options for y. Thus the number of edges {//. 2} is equal to /i(t> — k — 1).

Next, we count the number of edges {ij. 2} by choosing the vertex y first. Since

12

y G N(x), there are k possible choices for y. Now, we calculate the number of possible

choices for z. Since 2 6 N (y ) and z fi N(x) and z ^ x, there are k — A — 1 possible ways

of choosing 2. Therefore the number of edges {y, z} is k(k — A — 1) which completes

The following lemma stems directly from Definition 1.2.

Lemma 2.2 A symmetric (0,1 )-matrix B. with zero on the diagonal, is the adjacency

matrix of srg(e, k, A, /a) , if and only if

Proof We know that BJL] is equal to the number of common neighbours of vertices

% and j . Therefore by the definition of a strongly regular graph, the result follows. •

The complement of a strongly regular graph is also strongly regular.

Lemma 2.3 The complement of an srg(t», k, A, //) is an srg(v, v — k, v — 2k+jj, — 2, v —

2k + A - 2).

Proof If B is the adjacency matrix of a strongly regular graph, then J — I — B is

the adjacency matrix of its complement. Using Equation 1, we can see that

{J-I - Bf = (k - v)I + [v - 2k + n - 2)( J - I - B) + {v - 2k + A - 2 )B.

Therefore the complement of an srg(t>, k. A, f i) is an srg(t>, v — k, v — 2k + fi — 2. v —

2k + A - 2). •

If G = srg(f, k, A, fi) is disconnected, then /< -- 0, because there are at least two

non-adjacent vertices that have no common neighbours. In this case, G is the disjoint

union of m complete graphs Kn. A strongly regular graph that is connected, and its

complement is connected is called primitive To avoid the trivial case, throughout

this thesis, all strongly regular graphs are considered to be primitive.

2.2 Graph automorphism

In this thesis, we study strongly regular graphs with a non-trivial automorphism

group. In this section, we review the mathematical definition of the automorphism

group of a graph and its properties.

An automorphism is a permutation p on the vertices of a graph G such that for

any u.v G V(G), (up,vp) G E(G) if and only if (u,v) G E(G). This fact can also be

expressed using the matrix notation.

If p is a permutation, then the corresponding permutation matrix P = [p^] is

obtained by permuting the rows of the identity matrix by permutation p. P can also

be defined as follows:
 1 if jp = i

0 otherwise.

Let A be the adjacency matrix of a graph G, a permutation matrix P is an

automorphism of A if and only if

Pij =
PAP
t = A.

we can see that

t = A.

Therefore P is an automorphism of G. •

Let p and a be automorphisms of a graph G. Let per denote the composition of p and

a. Both p and a are the members of the symmetric group on V(G). We have

xy G E(G) & xpyp G E{G)

xpoypa G E(G).

Therefore, the set of automorphisms of a graph G under composition operation is

closed. Thus it forms a subgroup of the symmetric group on V(G). We call this

subgroup the automorphism group of G namely Aut(G).

The automorphism group of a graph shows us the symmetry of the graph. For

more information about the automorphism group of graphs please see [1] and [6].

Frucht. in [21] has shown that any group can be represented as the automorphism

group of a graph. Moreover, if the group is finite, then the graph can be taken as a

finite graph. Mendelsohn in [39] has further shown that for every (finite) group H.

15

there is a (finite) strongly regular graph G such that the automorphism group of G

is isomorphic to H.

If the automorphism group of a graph is the identity, then the graph is called

asymmetric. That means the graph has no non-trivial automorphism. It is shown

in [18] by Erdos that almost all graphs are asymmetric. It is also conjectured in [23]

that almost all strongly regular graphs are asymmetric.

On the other hand, Peter Cameron in [7] notes that "Strongly regular graphs lie

on the cusp between highly structured and unstructured".

Even though strongly regular graphs had been studied extensively since they were

introduced, there is not much known about the automorphism group of an arbitrary

strongly regular graph based on its parameters.

For this reason, we are interested to know more about the automorphisms of

strongly regular graphs.

2.3 Algebraic properties

2.3.1 The eigenvalues of a strongly regular graph

The adjacency matrix of a strongly regular graph has interesting algebraic properties.

For one, it has exactly three eigenvalues.

Let B be the adjacency matrix of a primitive srg(t>, k, A, //), and let j be an all-one

vector of size v. By the definition of a strongly regular graph, the row (column) sum

of B is k; thus B] = kj. Therefore, j is an eigenvector of B and k is one of the

eigenvalues of B. We will see that the multiplicity of the eigenvalue fc is 1.

We need to mention a few lemmas in order to prove the above statement. We

start with the definition of a reducible matrix.

Definition 2.4 An nxn matrix M is called reducible if there is a permutation matrix

P such that
 16

where M\ and M2 are square matrices of size at least one.

A matrix is called irreducible if it is not reducible. Clearly the adjacency matrix

of a connected graph is irreducible.

Eigenvalues of real non-negative matrices have interesting properties. The Perron-

Frobenius theorem characterises the properties of real positive and non-negative ma-

trices. We only mention the parts of the Perron-Frobenius theorem that we need.

Please refer to [28] for the complete version of the theorem.

Define the spectral radius p of a matrix A to be its largest eigenvalue:

The proof of the following theorem is given in [28].

Theorem 2.5 (Perron-Frobenius) Let A be a real non-negative irreducible ma-

trix. then

2. p(A) is an eigenvalue of A;

3. The algebraic multiplicity of p(A) is one.

Another fundamental theorem that we would need to use to conclude the main result

is the Gersgorin circle theorem [22].

For a square matrix A = [a.^]. define the deleted absolute row-sums of A as

The following theorem (Gersgorin circle or disc theorem) indicates that all the

eigenvalues of A are inside the closed discs centred at an with radius Rr in the complex

plane C. For the proof of this theorem, we refer the reader to [28].

Theorem 2.6 (Gersgorin) Let A = [a^] be a complex n x n matrix, and let

p(A) = max{|Aj(v4)l).

1. p(A) > 0;
 Di = {z e C : [2 - nii| < R,}.

17

where Ri s are the deleted absolute row-sums, then all the eigenvalues of A lie inside

the union of all Di "s.

The following lemma is related to the eigenvalues of a regular graph. For more

information about eigenvalues of regular graphs please see Brualdi and Ryser [4].

Lemma 2.7 Let A be any real irreducible non-negative matrix of order n with con-

stant row sum k and diagonal zero. Then k is an eigenvalue of A of multiplicity equal

to 1. Also if . A is another eigenvalue of A. then |A| < k.

Proof Let j be an all one vector of size n. We have Aj = kj. Therefore k is an

eigenvalue of A. Since the deleted absolute row-sum of every row of A is k, and

an = 0 for all z, all the eigenvalues of A lie inside the disk:

D = {z € C : \z\ < k},

by using Gersgorin's theorem (Theorem 2.6). Therefore no other eigenvalue of A has

modulus larger than k. Since k is the largest modulus eigenvalue,

p{A) = k.

We assumed that A is irreducible. Thus, we can use the Perron-Frobenius theorem

(Theorem 2.5), to see that the multiplicity of A is equal to 1. •

Since the strongly regular graph is primitive, it is connected, hence B is irreducible.

Thus the above theorem applies and k is an eigenvalue of B with multiplicity 1. We

will see that B has exactly two other eigenvalues. The following lemma is a standard

result that will help us to find tbe other two eigenvalues.

Lemma 2.8 Let M be any symmetric real-value matrix. Then the eigenvectors cor-

responding to different eigenvalues of M are orthogonal.

18

Proof Assume a and (3 are two different eigenvalues of M and x and y are the

corresponding eigenvectors. We have

rp rj-1
ay x = y Mx

= (x
TMy)
T

= (x
TPy)
T

= Py
Tx.

Since a ^ [5, we should have y
Tx = 0 and the previous equation is satisfied. •

Using Lemma 2.8, every other eigenvector of i?-should be orthogonal to j. Let a k

be another eigenvalue of B with the corresponding eigenvector x. Applying Equation

1, we have
 B
2X + (n - A)Bx + {[x- k)Ix - iiJx = 0. (2)

Using Lemma 2.8, we have
 Jx = 0.

Therefore Equation 2 simplifies to

a
2x + (/i — A)ax + ([/. — k)x = 0.

Since the eigenvector x ^ 0. we have

a 2 + (/x - A)a + {n - k) = 0. (3)

The eigenvalues of B must be the zeros of the quadratic equation (3). Therefore B

has exactly two more eigenvalues, which are the solutions of Equation 3:

r = ^ (A -/ i + - A*)
2 + 4(fc -/x) ) , (4)

and
 s = \( A-/x-V(A~//) 2 +4(/c-/*)) • (5)

Since k is always greater than //, in a primitive strongly regular graph, the expression

under the square root in Equations 4 and 5 is always positive. Therefore the two

eigenvalues are always distinct.
 19

Let / and g be the multiplicities of the eigenvalues r and s respectively. We have

V= l + f + g. (6)

Since the sum of the eigenvalues is equal to the trace of the matrix, we have

k + fr + gs = tr(B) = 0. (7)

Solving Equations 6 and 7 for / and g, and using the values of r and s in Equations

4 and 5, we find
 2 ^ ^( A - v.y + i{k - v) )

and

Using Equations 8 and 9, and restricting / and g to non-negative integers, we

have a very strong necessary condition on the parameter set (v. k, A, //).

If (u—!)(//—A) — 2k 0, then the requirement that / and g be integers implies that

\/(A — /i)2 + 4(k — fi) should be a perfect square. In this case, ^(A — //)2 + 4(k — //.)

is even, if and only if A — /x is even. Thus, from Equations 4 and 5, the eigenvalues r

and s are integers.

If (v — l)(ju — A) — 2k = 0, then f = g and r and s need not be integers. In this

case, the strongly regular graph is a conference graph.

The following lemma shows the eigenvalues of the complement of a strongly regular

graph.

Lemma 2.9 Let G be a strongly regular graph with parameters (v, k, A, p) and eigen-

values k. r, and s. Then G
c has eigenvalues v — k— 1. —r — 1, and — s — 1. Moreover

the eigenspaces of G' and G are the same.

Proof Let. B be the adjacency matrix of G. then the adjacency matrix of G
c is

B
c = J — I — B. We know that k is an eigenvalue of G and its eigenspaee is the space

of constant vectors. Let .r be a constant vector, then, we have:

B
cx =(./-/ - B).r = v.r - r - k.r = (r - k - l).r.

20

Therefore v — k — 1 is an eigenvalue of G
c, and its eigenspace is the same as the

eigenspace of k.

Let y be an eigenvector of B corresponding to the eigenvalue r. We know that y

is orthogonal to j. We have

B
cy = (J - I - B)y = 0 - y - ry = (- 1 - r)y.

Therefore —?•— 1 is an eigenvalue of G
c, and its eigenspace is the same as the eigenspace

of r.

We can show that — 1 — s is an eigenvalue of G
c in a similar way. •

The results of this subsection are summarised in the following theorem:

Theorem 2.10 Let G be a strongly regular graph with parameters (v.k,X,fi), then

the eigenvalues of G have the following properties:

1. G has exactly three eigenvalues which are k. r. and s where

and
 s = I (A - // - v/(A - /i)2 + 4 (k-f i

2. The multiplicity of eigenvalue k is 1 and the multiplicities ofr and s are f and

g respectively where

/=»/„-, + ("-DO'"A)-2 *
2 ^ V"(A - + 4(fc - „)

and  1 ( (v - l)(fj - A) - 2k
q = - f — 1 ^
2 ^ ^/(A - / ,) 2 + 4(A:-/x)/

3. If (v — l)(/i — A) — 2k 0. then the eigenvalues r and s are integers. On the

other hand if (v — — A) — 2k = 0. then f — g and r and s need not be

integers. The strongly regular graph is called a conference graph in this case.

21

2.3.2 The idempotent matrices

In this subsection, we introduce the concept of idempotent matrices for strongly

regular graphs. These matrices play a crucial role in the study of strongly regular

graphs.

In order to study these matrices, we need to use some classical definitions and

theorems of linear algebra.

The following definitions are obtained from [19] and [27], with some minor modi-

fications. Let V be a vector space and V\.... ,Vm be its subspaces.

Definition 2.11 The sum ofV\,..., Vm. namely VH \-Vm is the set of all vectors

V\ + H vm. where vt £ Vt for all 1 < i < m.

Using the definition of vector spaces, we can see that V\ -\ + Vm is a subspace of

V.

Definition 2.12 A vector space V is said to be the direct sum of its subspaces

Vi,..., Vm. namely
 V = Vj © • • • © Vm

if and only ifV = V\-1 + 14, and V\,... ,Vm are independent.

We state the following lemma without proof.

Lemma 2.13 V = V\ © • • • © Vm if and only if every vector v € V has a unique

representation
 v = vx -1 1- vrn

for some Vi € Vi.

Definition 2.14 A linear transformation E is called a projection or idempotent if

E
2 = E.

Let V = Vi©- - -©Vm and let w = hvm, for vi € V*, be the unique representation

of v as mentioned in Lemma 2.13. Define EiV = Ei is a linear transformation and

the range of Ei is V*. Since EiEiV = EiVi = Vi = E{v, we have

El = Ei.

Therefore Ei is a projection. The linear transformation Ei defined above is called the

projection ofV onto Vi.

A square matrix A = [a,j] with complex entries is called Hermitian if al3 = a*,.

Here the superscript * is the complex conjugate operation. A linear transformation

is called self-adjoint if its matrix is Hermitian.

In this part, we explain an important theorem called the Spectral theorem. We use

the Spectral theorem to find idempotent matrices E\ and E2 for any strongly regular

graph.

Spectral theory has been studied extensively in operator theory. The Spectral

theorem reveals the structure of normal operators on a Hilbert space. If N is a

normal operator on a finite dimensional Hilbert space H, then the theorem states

that the eigenvectors of N form an orthonormal basis for H [12], [20].

Here, we only explain the theorem on a finite dimensional space and refer the

reader to [12] for the general case. There are different ways to prove the finite dimen-

sional case.

In order to prove the Spectral theorem, we need to use some results on self-adjoint

linear transformations. We state the following theorem without a proof. For the proof

of this theorem please refer to [27, page 313].

Theorem 2.15 Let V be a real finite dimensional inner product space of positive

dimension and let T : V —> V be a self-adjoint linear transformation. Then T has a

real non-zero eigenvector.

The following theorem can be found in [27, page 314].

23

Theorem 2.16 LetV be a finite dimensional inner product vector space owerM and

let T : V —> V be a self-adjoint linear transformation. Then there exists a set of

eigenvectors ofT, which form an orthogonal basis for V.

Proof Proof by induction on the dimension of V.

If dim V = 1, then the proof is trivial. If dim V > 1, then by Theorem 2.15, T

has at least one real non-zero eigenvector xj. Let Vi be the subspace of V consisting

of all vectors orthogonal to x\. We have dim V\ — dim V — 1. By the induction

hypothesis V\ has an orthogonal basis consisting of eigenvectors of T. Call this basis

{x2..... xn}. Since xi.xt = 0, the vectors xt are independent from X\ for i > 2 . Thus

{xi,... . Xn} forms an orthogonal basis for V. •

Theorem 2.17 (Spectral Theorem) Let V be a finite dimensional inner product

vector space over R and let T : V —>• V be a self-adjoint linear transformation. Let

\i,...,\k be the distinct eigenvalues of T and Vt 's be their associated eigenspaces.

Let Ei be the projection ofV on Vi. Then

1. V = V! © • • • © 14:

2. Ej + --- + Ek= I;

3. T = \1E1 + --- + XkE/c-

Proof Using Theorem 2.16, we see that V = V\ ^ 1-14- We will show that V, 's

are independent in order to prove part. (1). Lemma 2.8 can be generalised to self-

adjoint linear transformations using a similar proof. Therefore the eigenvectors of T

corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. If v, £ Vi and v\ H b i'k = 0,

then, we have
 0 = = V{Vi
 = 11 2 -
j i
Thus the subspaces Vt are independent and

V = r, © • • • © 14.

Let a be an arbitrary vector. Since V = Vi © • • • © 14, we have a = a H Van

such that a, G V%. Since Ei s are projections of V on Vi, we have EtQ = a t . Therefore

(Ei + b Ek)a = « H h afc

which leads to

Let a be an arbitrary vector in V. Since Ei is the projection of V on Vi, we know

that

Since Vi is an eigenspace of T, we have

reader to [33] for its proof, since it is equivalent to the theorem we have already proved.

Some textbooks call Corollary 2.18 the Spectral theorem and deduce Theorem 2.17

as a corollary [42].

Corollary 2.18 Hermitian matrices are unitarily diagonisable which means if A is

Hermitian. then
 A = U*DU,

where the matrix U is a unitary matrix

( Ai 0 ^

D =
 \
 1

and Ai,... . An are the eigenvalues of A.

Now, we apply the Spectral theorem to the adjacency matrix B of G = srg(t», k, A, //)

to find the idempotent matrices E0, E\, and E2. Let V be R", the v dimensional

real vector space. Let V'o. Vj, and V2 be the eigenspaces of B corresponding to the

eigenvalues k, ?\ and s respectively. Define Ei to be the projection of V onto Vi for

i = 0,1,2. These matrices are called minimal idempotent matrices. From Theorem

2.17, we have the following equations:

Eo + Ei + E2 = I,

B = kE0 + rE\ + sE2,

and
 B
c = J-B- I = (v-k - 1)E0 + (- r - 1) ^ + (—s - 1 )E2.

Please note that the last equation comes from the fact that J — B — L the adjacency

matrix of the complement of G. has the same eigenspaces as B. After solving the

above three sets of equations, we find:

Eo = ~J, (10)
a

26

El = -L- - si + , (11)

and
 E2 = -L-{b-t I + —J\ . (12)
s - r \ v J

Definition 2.19 A Hermitian n x n matrix A is called positive semidefinite if for all

non-zero vectors z £ C".
 z*Az > 0. (13)

If the inequality in Equation 13 is strict (z*Az > 0/. then the matrix A is called

positive definite.

Lemma 2.20 Let E be an idempotent matrix, then E is positive semidefinite.

Proof Since E is idempotent, we have E
2 = E. Let x be an arbitrary complex

non-zero vector and let x = z*E. We have

(Ez)* = x*E* - x*E = x.

Thus
 x* = Ez.

Now. we have
 z*Ez = z*E
2z = (z*E)(Ez) = x*x > 0.

Therefore E is positive semidefinite. O

Every principal submatrix of a positive (semi) definite matrix is also positive

(semi) definite. We use this fact in our exhaustive search when the adjacency matrix

of the strongly regular graph is partially discovered. The proof of the following

theorem is obtained from [28] with some modification.

Theorem 2.21 Let A be a positive semidefinite matrix of size n. Then every prin-

cipal submatrix of A is positive, scmidefimle as well.

27

Proof Let S be a subset of {1,2.... . n} and let A' be the principal submatrix of A

by deleting rows and columns i from A whenever i E S. Let 2 = [2,;] be an arbitrary

complex non-zero vector, such that Zi = 0 whenever 1 E S.

Since A is positive semidefinte, we have

Let z' be the vector obtained by removing the i-th entries of 2 whenever % E S. We

have

Since z' can be any arbitrary non-zero vector of C, we conclude that A' is positive

Now, we can apply Lemma 2.20 to see that the matrices E\ and E2 in Equations 11

and 12 are positive semidefinite. Using Theorem 2.21, we can see that every principal

submatrix of E\ and E2 is positive semidefinite.

2.4 Necessary conditions

There exists some necessary conditions on the parameter set (v,k.X,fi). If these

conditions are not satisfied, there is no srg(t>, k, A, //). In this section, we show some

of these necessary conditions.

We obtain the first necessary condition from the parameter set of the complement

of G = srg(t>, k, A, //). We know that. G
c = srg(v, v - k\ v - 2k + /1 - 2, v - 2k + A - 2).

Therefore v - 2k + /z - 2 > 0 and c - 2k + A - 2 > 0. Thus

z*Az > 0.

z'*A'z = z*Az > 0.

semidefinite. The proof for positive definite is similar.  •

A, /t > 2k - v + 2.  (14)

Theorem 2.1 states that, if G is an srg(r. k. A.//), then

k{k - A - 1) = fi{v - k - 1).  (15)

28

which is a necessary condition on the parameters of a strongly regular graph.

Rationality conditions

In Section 2.3, we obtained Equations 8 and 9 for the multiplicities of the eigen-

values r and s of an srg(v, k, A, p). The fact that the multiplicities / and g should be

non-negative integers together with Equations 8 and 9, places tight restrictions on

the parameter set (v. k, A. /_i).

Any parameter set (v. k, A, /t) that satisfies the rationality condition and Equations

14 and 15 is called feasible.

There are several other necessary conditions on the parameter set of strongly

regular graphs. Among these, the most important conditions are as follows:

Krein conditions

Scott in [43], using a result of M.G. Krem [31], in harmonic analysis, showed that

(r + 1 ){k. + r + 2rs) < {k + r)(.s + l)2,

and  (s + l)(k + s + 2rs) < (k + s)(r + l)2.

The above two inequalities are called Krein conditions. The proof of the Krem con-

ditions is long and we omit it in this thesis. We refer the reader to [46, page 237] for

its proof.

It can be seen that, for example, the parameter set v = 28, k = 9, A = 0. // = 4,

is feasible, but it does not satisfy the Krem conditions.

Absolute Bound

Another useful necessary condition is the so called absolute bound. Delsate,

Goethals, and Seidel [16] introduced this bound, which is as follows:

V < \fU + 3).

The proof of absolute bound is long and we omit it in this thesis, we refer the reader

to [46, page 239] for its proof.

One can check that, the parameter set. v = 50. k = 21. A = 4. //. = 12, is feasible

and satisfies the Krem conditions, but it does not satisfy the absolute bound.

29

2.5 Some combinatorial constructions of strongly

regular graphs

In this section, we introduce some of the well-known constructions of strongly regular

graphs and describe their properties.

2.5.1 Triangular graph T(m)

Definition 2.22 The triangular graph T(m) has as vertices the 2-element subsets

of a set of cardinality m. Two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding

subsets are not disjoint.

The triangular graph T(m) can also be expressed as the line graph of the complete

graph Km.

Property 2.23 T(m) is an

srg(^m(m - 1), 2(m - 2), m - 2,4).

Proof Let S be a set with M elements. Since there are (™) 2-element subsets of S,

we have V = Let A = {ai, 02} be a subset of S. Adjacent vertices to A are the

subsets {«i, x} and {y, 0,2}, for all x.y «i and x,y / a2- There are rn — 2 choices

for x and rn, — 2 choices for y, therefore k = 2(m — 1). Using the same method of

counting, we can see that A = m — 2 and /i = 4.
 •

As an example, consider the complement of the Petersen graph given in Example 1.

The complement of the Petersen graph is T(5).

It is shown in [8] that every strongly regular graph with the same parameters as

T(m) is isomorphic to T(m).
 30

2.5.2 Strongly regular graphs from orthogonal arrays

Strongly regular graphs can be obtained from orthogonal arrays. An orthogonal array

can be considered as a generalisation of a Latin square.

Definition 2.24 A Latin square is a square matrix of order n such that its entries

are all from the set of symbols {l,...,n} and each symbol appears exactly once in

each row and exactly once in each column.

For any integer n, one can easily find a Latin square of size n. One construction is as

follows:

Take 1, 2,... , n as the first row. Row r, r > 1 is obtained by a cyclic shift of the

row r — 1 to the right.

Example 4.
 ^1 2 3 4^

4 1 2 3

3 4 1 2

^2 3 4 1j  •

Latin squares have been studied extensively. For more information on Latin squares,

we refer the reader to [17] and [34].

Definition 2.25 An orthogonal array OA(k, n) is a kxn
2 array of symbols from the

set {1,..., n} such that for any two rows r and s. all the ordered pairs s,). where

1 < i < n
2. are distinct.

It is not difficult to see that any Latin square of order n is equivalent to an OA(3, n).

For example, the Latin square in Example 4 is equivalent to the following orthogonal

array:
 ^111 1 222 2 333 3 4444 ^

123 4 123 4 123 4 123 4

^ 1 2 3 4 412 3 341 2 2 3 4 1 ^

31

Given an orthogonal array OA(k, n), one can define a graph G as follows:

1. The vertices of G are the n 2 column vectors of OA(k,n).

2. Two vertices are connected if and only if the corresponding vectors have the

same entry in one of the coordinates.

Theorem 2.26 The graph G defined above is an

srg(n2, (n - l)fc, n - 2 + (k - l){k - 2), k(k - 1)).

Proof We use a simple counting method to prove the theorem. Let X = OA(k, n).

Two columns of X have at most one common entry in the same coordinate. First, we

calculate the degree of the vertices. Let x be a vertex with the corresponding column

(:ri,... , Xk) in X. A vertex y with the corresponding column (yj,... , yk) is adjacent

to x if and only if xt = yi for some i and x3 ^ yj for all j ^ i. There are n — 1 such

vertices y for each coordinate i. Therefore, the total number of vertices adjacent to

x is equal to
 k(n — 1).

Let x and y be two adjacent vertices. Without loss of generality, we can assume that

the corresponding columns of x and y are (a, x2; -.. , xk) and (a, y 2 ,... , yk) respec-

tively, where x, ^ yl for all 2 < i < k. Let z be a vertex adjacent to both x and y.

Then the corresponding column of 2 is one of the following two types:

(i) (a. 22,..., 2^), where 2,; Xi and Zi y^ for all 2 < i < k.

(ii) (z\, 22,..., 2^), where z\ ^ a, Zi = xt and Zj = yj for only two indices i and j,

and for the rest of the indices I, 2/ xt and 2/ 7^ y;.

There are exactly n — 2 columns of type (i), and exactly (k — l)(k — 2) columns of

type (ii), therefore A, the number of common neighbours to any two adjacent vertices

in G. is equal to
 n — 2 + (k — 1)(A" — 2).

32

A method of counting similar to that used in type (ii), shows us that /i, the number

of common neighbours to any two non-adjacent vertices in G is equal to

k{k-l).
 •

One could also obtain the strongly regular graph directly from the Latin square

as follows:

Let L = [kj] be a Latin square of order n. Define A = [a(i.j)(t'.j')], 1 < i, j, i', j' < n

be a (0,1) matrix of order n
2 such that:

1 if i = i' or j = f or /tJ = lv

0 otherwise.

a(i.j)(i'J') -

Then A — I is the adjacency matrix of an

srg(n2, 2(n - 1), n, 6).

It can be easily checked that the graph G is an srg(16, 9,4.6). The complement of

G is called the Shrikhande graph. It is known that there are exactly two strongly

regular graphs with parameters (16, 9,4,6) up to isomorphism. The second graph can

be obtained from the following Latin square:

L2 =

2.5.3 Strongly regular graphs obtained from a pair of skew

symmetric Hadamard matrices

Here is another method of constructing strongly regular graphs. We review this

method because we will use it in one of our test cases. This method was introduced

by Pasechnik in [41], In his paper he uses the concept of association schemes, but

to simplify the concept, we only use adjacency matrices to show the results. By

this method one could obtain a strongly regular graph from two skew symmetric

Hadamard matrices of order 4n.

Definition 2.27 A matrix H of order n with ±1 entries is called an Hadamard

matrix if
 HH
t = nl,

where I is the identity matrix.

An Hadamard matrix H is skew symmetric if H + H
T = 21.

It is not difficult to show that the order of an Hadamard matrix is either 1. 2 or 4k.

Jacques Hadamard in [24] conjectured that there exists an Hadamard matrix of order

4n for all integers n > 0. This conjecture is still open.

Example 6. H, the following matrix, is an Hadamard matrix of order 4:

where "—represents —1.
 H =
 ' l 1 1 ^

1 1 - -

1 - 1 -

v
1 - - y  •

Example 7. H. the following matrix is a skew symmetric Hadamard matrix:

35

H =
 111 1

-11 -

--1 1

-1- 1  •

A skew symmetric Hadamard matrix is called normalised if all the entries of the

first row are positive. The matrix in Example 7, is a normalised skew symmetric

Hadamard matrix.

Let Hi and H2 be normalised skew-symmetric Hadamard matrices of order An.

Let E\ and E2 be matrices obtained from II \ and H2, respectively, by removing the

first row and the first column. For example, if Hi is the matrix in Example 7, then

/

Ei =
 \ 1 1

1 1

1 - 1

Since the matrices //,, i = 1,2, are skew symmetric Hadamard matrices, we have
V  7

EjEf = Ani - J,  (16)

and
 EiEi = Ei(21 -Ej ) = J - 4ni + 2 E h (17)

Moreover, let I be the identity matrix of order 4n — 1 and J be the all one matrix of

order An — 1. Since the row sum and column sum of the E,'s are equal to 1, we have

Ei J — J Ej — J.

Now, we define two matrices 1\ and T2 as follows:

Ti =^(Ei + J - 21).
 (18)

Let
 A = /', y T[ + Ti >: T>.

36

and
 B = Tj <g> T2 + T[ g T2t,

where the operator <gi is the matrix Kronecker product operator. Let X

m x n matrix and Y be another matrix of any size, then
 [xij\ be an

=
 /

V
 xnY  XlnY  \

/

The Kronecker product has many interesting properties; however, we only mention

two of them here, since we will use them later in this thesis. Let X, Y, X', and Y'

be matrices of proper size, then, we have

XX' <g> YY' = {X ® Y){X' <8> y').

This property is called the mixed product property. We also have

(X ® y)
T = X
T S Y
T.

Theorem 2.28 The matrices A and B defined above are the adjacency matrices of

two strongly regular graphs with parameters

((4n - l) 2, 8n2 - 8n + 2,4n 2 - 6n + 3, 4n2 - 6n + 2).

Proo f We will show that A and B satisfy Equation 22 on page 42. Before calcu-

lating A
2 and B
2, we first calculate T{Tj and T
2 since we will need to use them later.

Using the definition of Ti and Equations 16 and 18, we have:

4 T{Ti  = (Ei + J - 2I){Ej + J - 21)

= EiEj + EiJ - 2Ei + JEj + J
2 - 2J - 2Ej - 2J + 41

= - J + 4nl + J - 2E{ + J + (4n - 1 )J - 2 J - 2 E j - 2 J + 4/

= (4n — 4) J + 4n.I.
 37

Therefore,
 T{Tj = (n- l)J + nI.

Using Equation 17, we have:

AT? = (E + J-2I)
2

= E
2 + EiJ - 2El + J ^ + J 2 - 2 J - 2£z - 2J + 4/ 2

= £ 2 + (4ra - 3) J - AEi + AI

= (An - 2) J - 2Ei + (4 - An)I

= 4n J — 47; — AnI.
 (19)

Therefore
 T = nJ — Ti — ni.  (20)

Using Equation 19, we can calculate A
2 as follows:

A
2 = (T1®T? + T?®T2)
2

,2 T
= Tt ® T f + TiTj* S T2T2 + 7? '7\ <g> T2T2
J + T f ® T^

= (2n2 - Qn + 2) J <g> J + (4n2 - 2n)7 <8> I + Ti <8> Tf + Tf <8> T2

= [An
2-Qn + 2)J ®J+ (An
2-2n)I ®I + A.

Using Equation 20, one can calculate B
2 as well. We omit this calculation (it is

similar to the calculation of A
2) and show the result which is the following:

B
2 = (4n2 - 6n + 2) J ® J + (4n2 - 2n)I <g> I + A.

We see that both A and B satisfy Equation 22 which completes the proof.  •

\  •

We are going to show that isomorphic normalised skew Hadamard matrices gen-

erate isomorphic strongly regular graphs. Let 7] and T2 be two matrices obtained

from skew symmetric Hadamard matrices as mentioned above. Let T[ be a matrix

isomorphic to 7\ and V2 be a matrix isomorphic to TV Let us further assume that. A

39

and B are Pasechnic strongly regular graphs obtained from T\ and T2, and A' and B'

are Pasechnic strongly regular graphs obtained from T[ and T2.

Since T\ is isomorphic to T[ and T2 is isomorphic to T2, we have:

T[ = P\T\Pl.

and
 n = P2T2PI

Where P\ and P2 are some permutation matrices, define

P : = P I ® P 2 .

We can see that P is a permutation matrix as well. Using the properties of the

Kronecker product we mentioned on page 37, we have:

A! = T[®T'2
T + T[
T <g>7£

= (PITRPF ) ® (P 2 T 2 T P 2 T ) + (P^PL ) 0 (P 2 T 2 P 2 T )

= (P I ® P2)(T1 0 T 2 T )(P 1 T ® P 2 R ) + (PI ® P2)(T? (g) T 2 )(P 1 T 8) P 2 T )

= P(T J ® T 2 T )P T + P(7 f ® T2)P
t

- P(T, 0 7 F + ® T2)P

= PAP
T.

As a result of the above equation, we conclude that A' is isomorphic to A. The same

procedure can be followed to show that B' is isomorphic to B.

2.6 Strongly regular graphs and partial geometries

A partial geometry pg(s, t, a) with a = 1 is called a generalised quadrangle and

denoted by GQ(.s, /.). A GQ(1,1) is the usual quadrangle with four points and four

edges.

The concept of a partial geometry was introduced by Bose [2], A partial geometry

is a generalisation of the concept of a generalised quadrangle. Generalised quadrangles

were introduced by Tits [45] as a generalisation of the quadrangle GQ(1,1).

40

Theorem 2.29 The point graph of a pg(s, t, a) is an

SRG ( { s + 1^
st + a\s(t + 1), s - 1 + t(a - 1), a{t + 1)). (21)
Q

Proof Since there are t + 1 lines passing through a point P and there are s points

other than P on each of these lines, we have k = s(t +1). Let Pi and P2 be two points

on a line Z. There are s — 1 other points on I which all are collinear with both Pi and

P 2. Now, we count the number of points not on Z which are collinear with both Pj

and P2. There are t lines (li,l2. • • •, h) passing through P\ other than I. Exactly a

lines on P2 are concurrent with each Z^, i = 1,2, ... , t, (one of these lines is Z, therefore

a — 1 points on k are collinear with both Pi and P2 and are not on I). Therefore, we

have t,(a — 1) points not on Z, collinear with both Pj and P2. Thus A = 5 — l + t(a — 1).

Using a similar argument, we can see that // = a(t + 1). The value of v can be

obtained using Theorem 2.1 •

A strongly regular graph of the form (21) is called a psuedogeometric (s,t,a)-graph.

Such a graph is geometric if it is the point graph of a pg(s, f. a).

Lemma 2.30 A psuedogeometric graph is geometric if and only if it is the point

graph of a partial linear space.

Proof The following proof is based on [9].

Since any partial geometry is also a partial linear space, the necessary condition

is easily resolved. We shall now prove the sufficient condition.

Let S = pls(,s. i). Because the point graph is geometric, we have

T(S) = srg(
{s + 1){st + a \ s(t + 1), 5 - 1 + t(a - 1), a(t + 1)),
a

for some integer a . It is enough to show that S = pg(.s, t. o). Fix a line Z. For a

point P not incident with Z. let a p be the number of lines on P concurrent with Z.

41

We have:
 p<£i Mel
= E' s

Mei

= (s + 1 )ts.

We also have:

Therefore:
 = J ] \{Q£L,M ~Q,N~Q}\

M.N el

M.N el

P^/
 p^/ p<fi v y P£f
ap
p<t,i
= 0.

Thus op = Q for every P ^ / and 5 = pg(s. I. a).  •

The adjacency matrix of the point graph can be obtained easily from the incidence

matrix of the partial geometry. Let A be the incidence matrix of V = pg(s, t, a) and

B be the adjacency matrix of the point graph of V. The {i. j) entry of B
2 is the

number of vertices adjacent to i and j. Since the point graph is an srg(y. k, A, fi), we

have  k if i = j

(B%  A if Bij = 1

//. if Bu = 0.

Thus
 B
2 = (k - //)/ + ,,.J + (A - i,)B.  (22)

42

Since A is the adjacency matrix of P, we have

1 if the points i and j are collinear

(•AAf)ZJ — \ 0 if the points i and j are not collinear

t + 1 if i= j.

Therefore by the definition of a point graph.

AA
T = B + (T + 1)/.  (23)

Constructing a partial geometry from its point graph has been unsuccessful in most

of the cases, but Haemers in [25] constructed a pg(4,17, 2) from an srg(175, 72, 20, 36).

Chapter 3

Orbit matrices

3.1 Introduction

The size of the search for the unknown strongly regular graphs we are interested in

is very large. We have to use mathematical techniques to reduce this size. One of

the techniques is the use of an automorphism group. In this chapter, we shall show-

how the assumption of a non-trivial automorphism group may enable us to finish the

search in a feasible amount of time.

Assuming that the strongly regular graph has a non-trivial automorphism group,

in this chapter we develop the theory of orbit matrices for strongly regular graph for

the first, time.

3.2 Related work

Rudolf Mathon in [37] introduced the concept of orbit, matrices for block designs.

In that, paper, orbit matrices are referred to as "tactical decompositions". Clement.

Lam in [32] showed how to use orbit, matrices by the use of a program called BDX

to construct block designs. Rudolf Mathon in [36] introduced the concept, of block

valencies for self-complementary strongly regular graphs. A graph is called self-

complementary if there is a permutation p on its vertices which maps every edge to

44

a non-edge and vice versa. Block valencies are computed based on the partitions

that p induces on the adjacency matrix of the self-complementary strongly regular

graph. Using these, a computer program was implemented in [36] to find all self

complementary strongly regular graphs with less that 54 vertices.

3.3 The construction

Let G(V,E) be an srg(v, k, A, /i). Suppose an automorphism of G partitions the set

of vertices V into b orbits Oi, 02,... , Ob- Define ni = |Oj| for 1 < i < b.

Let V1./U2, • . • , vn be an ordering of the vertices of G that preserves the ordering

{0\, O2, • • . , Ob)- In other words, if i < j, then for all vi E Oi and vm G Oj, I < m:

Using this ordering, the orbits of V divides the adjacency matrix B of G into

submatrices
 B = [BZJ],

where Bl:j is the adjacency matrix of vertices in Ol versus vertices in Oj.

As an example, consider the point graph of the partial geometry pg(2, 2,1) shown

in Example 2 on page 4. It is an srg(15, 6,1, 2). As a point graph, the vertices are the

points {Pi, P2,.... P|5}. For simplicity, we denote vertex Pi by i. The permutation

(1,2,3,4, 5)(6, 7,8, 9,10)(11,12,13,14,15) on the vertices is an automorphism of the

point graph. This automorphism produces three orbits of size five, namely 01 =

{1,2,3,4,5}, 02 = {6, 7,8,9,10}, and 03 = {11,12,13,14,15}.

The row sum and column sum of the submatrices Bij are extremely important in

the theory we are developing. Define three matrices C = [%], R = [r^], 1 < i.j < 6,

and N such that
 Cij = column sum of B,j,

Tij = row sum of BX].

and
 N = diag (ni,n2,...77fc).

Note that R is related to C by the formula

Since the adjacency matrix is symmetric,

R = C
T.

For example, the matrices C and R corresponding to the matrix B are:

/ 2 3 1 ^

C =

The orbit sizes are on the diagonal of the matrix N
V  /

/ 5 0 0 ^

N =  0 5 0

0 0 5 /

The matrix C is the orbit matrix of the graph G. It gives structural information

about the adjacency matrix B.

We next establish a relationship involving the matrices C, iV, and R. This will

be our starting point for a computer enumeration of all the possible orbit matrices C

for a given orbit partition of the vertices.

Let W = B
2, where Wuv counts the number of paths of lengths 2 between vertices

u and v. Using the same orbit partition of the vertices, W can also be partitioned in

W = [ly^-], where i and j are the indices of the orbits.

We continue our example of srg(15,6,1,2) and calculate W as follows:

Define a 6x 6 matrix S = [.s?J] such that

Sij = sum of all the entries in Wl}.

Since B
2 = (k—n)I+fiJ+{\—fj)B, we have W^ = n)I +{X—fj)Bij. Please

note that in the second equation, the dimension of I is iii x nl and the dimension of

J is rii x rij. We have

Sij = dij(k - [i)nj + unirij + (A - n)ci:)nr

In our example, the matrix is calculated as follows:
 (24)

( 70 45 65 ^

The matrix S can also be calculated in a different way.

Lemma 3.1
 CNR = S.  (25)

Proof Let a, be a vector of size v such that

f 1 if.? € Oi,
ttiO) = <
I 0 otherwise.

The vectors are chosen such that s,j = aiB 2 aJ . Define 1 < i < 6, to be a row

vector of size i> such that ^(A:) = c{j for k G Similarly, define (3j, 1 < j < b, to be

a row vector of size v such that pj(k) = rij for k e Oi. We have

SlJ = ctiB
2aJ = {aiB)(BaJ)
b
= r)iPj = '^cikrkjnk = (CNR)ij.
k=I  •

Continuing our example, we calculate ,s]2 for the matrix 5 , using the previous proof,

we have
 a j = (11111 00000 00000),

Q 2 = (00000 11111 00000),

= (22222 33333 11111),

and
 fo = (33333 00000 33333).

We can see that
 Si2 = aiB 2 o 2 = rj\02 = 45.

3.4 Properties of orbit matrices and prototypes

Lemma 3.1 allows us to derive a set of integer equations for the possible entries in row

r of the matrix C. The only information we need are the parameters of the strongly

49

regular graph G\ therefore, these equations are independent of the matrix B. Solving

these equations will help us to find the orbit matrix C without knowing the matrix

B.
 Using Equation 25, we have
 t t
•Srr = Crkrkrnk -
 clk
nk- (26)

k=1 1

Using Equation 24, we have

srr = (k — /j,)nr + pr?r + (A — p)crrnr. (27)

For simplicity, we restrict ourself to the case where the orbits are either of size one

or of size p, a prime. Let ib be the number of orbits of size p and <p be the number of

orbits of size one. <p and -0 satisfy the following equation.

<p
 = v — pip (28)

In this case, we have two types of rows (columns). Fixed rows (columns) are those

whose orbit size is one and non^fixe'd rows (columns) are those with orbit size p.

Without taking into account the ordering of the entries in a row of C, we first

consider the distribution of such entries. We call this a prototype of a row of C. Each

prototype will tell us the possible number of occurrences of each integer as an entry

of a particular row of C.

Consider an arbitrary fixed row r of C. The possible value of each entry of that

row, regardless of being a fixed column or non-fixed column, is either 0 or 1.

Let .To and xi be the number of zeros and ones respectively on the fixed columns

of row r. Let yo and //i be the number of zeros and ones respectively on the non-fixed

columns of row r. Since the number of fixed columns is we have xo + x\ = d>.

Similarly we have y0 + yj = •</;. Since the row sum of the matrix B is equal to k. we

have
 + Plh = k-

50

Thus, we have the following set of equations:

Xo + Xj = (f>,

Vo + yi =</>, (29)

+ pyi = k.

We define a Fixed Prototype as a non-negative integer solution of xo, xj, IJQ, and y\,

satisfying this set of linear equations.

Now consider an arbitrary non-fixed row r of C. The possible values of the fixed

column entries of row r are either 0 or p. The possible values of the non-fixed column

entries of row r can be 0.1 ,.. . ,p. Let xo and xp be the number of zeros and p s on

the fixed columns of row r. Let i = 0,1,... . p be the number of €s on the non-

fixed columns of row r. Similar to the situation with columns, we have xo + xp = d>

and Yli=o Vi = V-'- Also, since the row sum of B is equal to k, by counting, we have

xp + Wi ~ Using Equation 26, we have

p
p
2-fp + ^ i
2pyi = srr.
i=1

Thus, we have the following set of equations:

XQ + xp  = <p,

+  Ijp

+  PVp  = k.

+  p
2yP  = SRR
 (30)
2/o + 2/i + v 2 + 2/3 + • •

xp + 2/i +
 2 y2 + 32/3 + -•

pxp + 2/i + 4 y2 + 9 2/3 +

We define a Non-Fixed Prototype as a non-negative integer solution of xo, xp,

2/0, • • •, 2/p, satisfying this set of linear equations.

In the above equation, the value of s r r is obtained from Equation 27. Using

Equation 27, we can generate a separate set of equations for each value of crr. The

following lemma puts a restriction on these values.

Lemma 3.2 If nr is odd. then crr is even.

51

Proof Let Y be the subgraph induced by Oi. Brr is the adjacency matrix of Y.

Y is a regular graph of degree c rr. By counting the number of edges of Y in two

different ways, we have
 2\E(Y)\ = nTcTT.

Since n r is odd, c r r must, be even. •

Since 0 = v — pip. the smallest possible value for 0 is z = v mod p. The possible

values of 0 are 2, 2 + p. z + 2p, .... z + p  The following two theorems state
p

that, once we find no fixed (or non-fixed) prototype for a given 0, then there is no

need to consider any larger 0\s when 0 > 2p.

Theorem 3.3 If there exists a fixed prototype with 0 fixed columns and 0 > 2p. then

there is a fixed prototype with (j) — p fixed rows.

Proof Since there exists a fixed prototype with 0 fixed columns, there is an integer

solution (zo, yo, y\) for Equation 29. Consider the following equations for a fixed

prototype with (j) — p fixed rows:

•r'0 + x'j =<t>-p,

y'o + y\ + h (
31)

•>'1 + piA =
 k-

If XQ > p, then x'0 = xo — p, x\ = x , . y'0 = y0 + 1, and y\ = yi would be a solution for

Equation 31, and Xq, X\, y'(], and y\ are all non-negative.

If xi > p. then Xq = .r0, x'i = xi — p, y'0 = y0, and y\ = y\ + 1 would be a solution

for Equation 31, and X'j . y'0, and y[ are all non-negative.

Since 0 > 2p. one of these two cases has to be true and Equation 31 has a non-

negative integer solution. •

Theorem 3.4 If there exists a non-fixed prototype with, o fixed rows and 0 > 2p.

then there is a non-fixed prototype with 0 — p fixed rows.

52

Proo f Since there exists a non-fixed prototype with 4> fixed rows, there is a non-

negative integer solution (xo, xpi yo, yi,... , yP) for the set of Equations 30. Consider

the following equations for a non-fixed prototype with 0 — p fixed rows:

x'0 + xp =(f>- p,

* + * + * + * + - + * + (32)

x'p + y[ + 2y'2 + 3y's + ••• + py'p = fc,

px'p + y\ + 4 y'2 + 9y'3 + ••• + p% = srr/p.

Since (p > 2p, either xo > p or xp > p. If xo > p, then x'Q = Xo — p, x'p = xp,

Ho
 = ?/o + l, and y' = yt for 1 < i < p would be a solution for Equation 32, and

xp, y'o, y'l,..., y'p) are non-negative.

If xp > p, then x'0 = xo, x'p = xp — p., and y\ = y^ for 0 < i < p — 1, and y'p = yp +1

would be a solution for Equation 32, and (x[,, x'p. y'0. y[,..., y'p) are non-negative.

Since 0 > 2p, one of these two cases has to be true and Equation 32 has a non-

negative integer solution.  •

3.5 Upper bounds on the number of fixed points

In this section, we introduce some new upper bounds on q> the number of fixed points

of an automorphism of a strongly regular graph. We need to use the concept of orbit

matrices to derive some of these upper bounds, but some upper bounds are obtained

independently, without the use of orbit matrices.

Let B be the adjacency matrix of G = srg(?>, k, X, //,), having a non-trivial auto-

morphism. Let B' = [b'tj] be the adjacency matrix of the subgraph of G, induced by

all the non-fixed vertices. Let a = max(A, ft). The following lemma gives a restriction

on row-sums of B'.

Lemm a 3.5 Let G = srg(v. k. X, p) and further assume that G has a non-trivial

automorphism p. Let H be the subgraph of G. induced by all the non-fixed vertices of

53

G. Then
 5(H) > fc-max(A.//).

Proof Let i be a non-fixed vertex of G and let y = xp. Let 2 be any fixed vertex

of G adjacent to x. Since (z,x) G E(G), we have

(zp,xp) = (2, y) G E(G).

Thus any fixed vertex adjacent to x is adjacent to y as well. Since x and y have

at most max(A./i) common neighbours, there are at most max (A, //) fixed vertices

adjacent to x. Since G is a regular graph of degree k, every non-fixed vertex of G

has at least k — max(A,/i), non-fixed neighbours. Thus

8(H) >k — max(A./t).
 •

Lemma 3.6 Let A = [a^] be an n x n positive semidefinite matrix. Then

Y , -
i-j

Proof Since A is positive semidefinite, we have

z'Az > 0,

for any 2 G Cn. Take the all one vector j as 2, the result follows directly. •

Lemma 3.6 is a special case of the Fejer's theorem. For more information about Fejer's

theorem, refer to [28, page 459].

The following theorem gives us an upper bound on the number of fixed points.

The interesting fact about this bound is that- it is independent from the selection of

P-

Theorem 3.7 Let r < s < k be the eigenvalues of an svg(v, A:, A, /1). then

max (A. //.)
<£> < — v.
k — s

54

Proof Let B be the adjacency matrix of the strongly regular graph and B' = [b'ZJ}

be the principal submatrix of B corresponding to the non-fixed vertices.

We know that the idempotent matrix E\ in Equation 11 is positive semidefinite.

Therefore, every principal submatrix of E\ is positive semidefinite. Let E[ = [e^] be

the submatrix of E\ corresponding to the non-fixed vertices. Let us further assume

that E[ is of size n. Let a = max(A. /i). From Lemma 3.5, we know that the row sum

of the matrix B' is at least k — a. Therefore,

By considering that r — s < 0 and combining Equations 11, 33, and 34, we have

(33)
y

In order for E[ to be positive semidefinite, using Lemma 3.6, we have
 (34)

> 0.

Since r — s < 0 and n > 0, we have
 ^ ^
(k — a) — s-\ -n < 0.
v

After simplifying, we get  av
n> v — .
k — s'

which implies
 •

As an example, consider an srg(99,14.1. 2), using Theorem 3.7. we can see that, an

automorphism of this strongly regular graph, can have at most 18 fixed points.

55

Theorem 3.8  k
2 - k
(f> <v ——- + 2k — max(A. u) — 2.
max(A, jj.)

Proof Let a = max(A, //). Let B be the adjacency matrix of the strongly regular

graph and B' = \b'tJ] be the principal submatrix of B corresponding to the non-fixed

vertices. Let n be the size of B'. Using Lemma 3.5, the matrix B' has at least k — a

ones in each column. Since any two vertices have at most a common neighbours, we

have:
 B
n < (k - a)I + aJ. (35)

We count the sum of entries of B'
2 in two different ways. First, since B' is symmetric,

we have B'
2 = B'B'
T. Let r be an arbitrary column of B'. By Lemma 3.5 there are

at least k — a ones on r. By counting the number of un-ordered pairs of l's on the

column r, we have
 £ b'irb'jr > {k — a)(k — a —1).

1 <i-j<n.ijtj

Let s be the sum of all the entries of B'
2. except the ones on the diagonal. In fact, s

is the sum of inner products of different rows. We have

n

S =  ^'jr

1 <i.j<n.i^j r— 1

n

= S
 b'"-
b'jr
r= 1 l<i.j<n.i^j
> n(k — a)(k — a — 1).

Using Equation 35, we have
 s < an(n — 1).

Using the last two calculations, we have

(k — a){k — a — 1 )n < an(n — 1).

One could simplify the above equation to see

k
2 - k
n > 2k + a + 2.
c\
 56

Since n = v — <f>, we have
 k
2 -k
<b<v + 2k - a - 2.
a
 •

As an example, again consider an srg(99,14,1, 2), using Theorem 3.8, we can see that,

an automorphism of this strongly regular graph, can have at most 32 fixed points.

We have realised, in all our test cases, Theorem 3.7 gives a better upper bound

than Theorem 3.8, but we have not been able to prove that the upper bound obtained

from Theorem 3.7 is always lower than the upper bound obtained from Thorem 3.8.

The following theorem states that when the orbit size is large enough, there is no

fixed point.

Theorem 3.9 If p > k and /j, 0. then 0 = 0.

Proof Consider Equation 29. Since p > k, the only solution to the equation is the

following:
 (•'•<). .f). y0, //i) (o - k. k. i \ 0).

Let u be a fixed vertex and v be a non-fixed vertex. Since y\ = 0, we have Buv = 0.

Consider an arbitrary vertex x different from u and v. Again, since y\ = 0, if x is a

fixed vertex, we have Bxv = 0. If x is a non-fixed vertex, we have Bxu — 0. In both

cases ,r is not a common neighbour of u and v. Thus either // = 0 or there is no fixed

point. •

Corollary 3.10 If p > k and // ^ 0. then v should be divisible by p.

The following theorems put some bound on the number of fixed points a strongly

regular graph can have.

Theorem 3.11 If 6 < k - 1 and p > max(A, //). then & < v/(p + 1).

57

Proof Using Equation 29, since X\ < 0 < k, we have pyi > 1. Therefore, y\ > 1.

Consider the submatrix of C corresponding to the fixed rows and non-fixed columns

and call it C. Since y\ > 1, there is at least one "1" in each row of C". Since

C' is of size <p x ill there are at least 0 ones in C". If 0 > ip, by the pigeon hole

principle, there is a column of C that, has more than one 1 in it. Therefore there

are two fixed rows, i and j , and a non-fixed column k such that CikCjk = 1- But, we

have pCikCjk < max(A, fi) since the inner product of two fixed rows of B is less than

max(A, p), which contradicts the assumption that p > max(A. //.). Therefore 0 < tp-

Since (p + pip = v, we have 0 < v/(p + 1). •

3.6 Computer construction of orbit matrices

After we have obtained the prototypes, we can construct the matrix C by backtrack-

ing. The first row can be constructed easily using its prototype. For the first row we

know the number of occurrences of each value. The order of entries is not. important,

for the first row as the orbits of the same type are still free to be permuted among

themselves.

The rest, of the rows can be constructed recursively. Assume that the matrix C is

constructed up to the row r — 1. To construct row r, first we consider the prototype.

Using Equation 24. for 1 < i < r, we have

SiT — piliTlr + (A — jx)a rn r. (36)

Since i < r, the value of cir is already known. Hence the value of sir is known. On

the other hand, using Equation 25, we have

6
Sir =
 Cik
Crknr- (37)
fc= 1

The new row r has to satisfy Equation 37 for all 1 < i < r. The entries in row

r are constructed recursively starting from column 1 and ending at column b. Since

the variables on the right-hand side of Equation 37 are all non-negative, if we are at

58

a column b' < b, Equation 37 can be replaced by

v
Sir CikCrk^r • (38)
k=\

For each column b', we try all possible values for crly. but ensuring that it satisfies

Equation 38.

Since B is an adjacency matrix, it is symmetrical. Thus, for k < r, c.rk =

<-'kr{nk/nr), which is already known.

The number of candidate matrices for C can further be reduced by isomorph

rejection, since the fixed and non-fixed columns can permute among themselves re-

spectively.

We finish this chapter using an example, to see how the orbit matrices for strongly

regular graphs are constructed.

Exampl e 9. In this example, we consider srg(15. 6,1.3). Assume p — 3 and assume

that there are three orbits of size one and four orbits of size three. Therefore 0 = 3,

ib = 4, ni = ri2 = n3 = 1 and n4 = r?,5 = iiq = n7 = 3.

First, we calculate the fixed prototype using Equation 29. We have the following

equations:
 •T0 + -TL = 3,

I/o + V I — 4, (39)

xi + 3yi = 6.

The only non-negative integer solutions of the above equations are

(xo,xi,yo. yi)e{(0. 3, 3,1), (3,0,2,2)}.

Since the diagonal of B is zero. c r r = 0 when r is a fixed row. Therefore, there has

to be at least one zero in the fixed columns. Thus XQ > 1 and the first solution is

not acceptable, implying (.to. .<"1. yo, y\) = (3. 0, 2. 2). Now, we consider the non-fixed

•59

prototype for the non-fixed rows of the incidence matrix. Equation 30 gives:

x0 + x 3 = 3,

Vo + V\ + 2/2 + 2/3 = 4,  (40)

x 3 +y i + 22/2 + 3y3 = 6,

3^ 3 + 2/1 + 4y 2 + 9^ 3 = s„/3.

Using Equation 27, we have srr — 36 — 6crr. The possible values of c r r are 0, 1, and

2. We shall consider all these cases.

For c r r = 0, we have s r r = 36. The solutions of Equation 40 are

(xo , xz , 2/0,2/1,2/2,2/3 ) G { (0,3,1,3,0,0) ,

(1,2,1,2,1,0),

(2,1,1,1,2,0),

(3,0,1,0,3,0),

(3,0,0,3,0,1) }.

Since c r r = 0, we have y0 > 0. Therefore the last solution is not possible.

We do not need to consider the case crr = 1 using Lemma 3.2.

For crr = 2, we have srr = 24. In this case the prototype in 40 has no non-negative

integer solution.

Now, we build the matrix C row by row. The first row is a fixed row. Its only

prototype is (3,0, 2, 2), meaning 3 zeros for the fixed columns, and 2 zeros and 2 ones

among the non-fixed columns. By permuting the columns, we can assume that the

first row is [000(0011].

Now, we need to construct the second row. Since C12 = 0, Equation 36 implies

S12 = 3 — 2C12 = 3.

Thus by Equation 37, we have
 = 3.

A-= I
 60

Since we already know the first row of C, we have:

3C'26 + 3C'27
 = 3.  (41)

The prototype for the second row is (3,0,2,2). Considering Equation 41 and, by

permuting the columns, we can assume that the second row is [OOOjOlOl]. By a

similar argument the third row is [000|1001] up to isomorphism.

Consider the forth row. By Equation 36, we have

.Si4 = 9 — 6C14 = 9,

S24 = 9 - 6 c 2 4 = 9 .

S34 = 9 - 6C34 = 3.

Considering the values of sz-4, by Equation 37, we have:

3C46 + 3C47 = 9,

3C45 + 3C47 = 9,

3C44 + 3C47 = 3.

The only solutions of the above set of equations are

(c44-, C45, C<J6j C47) G { (1,3,3,0),

(0,2,2,1) }.

The first solution does not belong to any non-fixed prototype, however the second

solution does. Therefore the forth row up to isomorphism is [003)0221].

Similarly, we construct the rest of the rows of C by using their prototypes. Equa-

tions 36, 37, and by permuting the rows in order to consider the symmetry.

Finally, up to isomorphism one can see that there is only one possible solution for

the column sum matrix, which is the following:

61

0  0  0  0  0  1  1

0  0  0  0  1  0  1

0  0  0  1  0  0  1

Chapter 4

Computer search for strongly

regular graphs

We have implemented a computer program to search for unknown strongly regular

graphs. Our algorithm is an exhaustive backtrack search based on orbit matrices.

Throughout the thesis we call this program the SRG program.

After an orbit matrix for the desired strongly regular graph is obtained, the SRG

program tries to find the adjacency matrix of the strongly regular graph by expanding

the entries of the orbit matrix into blocks of the adjacency matrix.

Several combinatorial and algebraic techniques have been used in pruning the

backtrack search tree.

The SRG program also has the ability to estimate the size of the search tree using

a random probing method. This random probing technique can be used as well to

perform a randomised search.
 63

4.1 History of computer search for strongly regu-

lar graphs

The existence or non-existence of strongly regular graphs has been studied using com-

puter searches. It was shown in [5] by the use of a computer search that srg(49,16, 3, 6)

does not exist. The uniqueness of some strongly regular graphs up to isomorphism

was shown by the use of an exhaustive search in [15]. Complete classification of some

strongly regular graphs with small parameters has been performed in [13], [26], [38],

and [44], by the use of computer searches. Corneil and Mathon in [14] describe several

algorithmic techniques for the construction of strongly regular graphs and other com-

binatorial configurations. In this paper general search techniques for combinatorial

configurations such as hill-climbing and backtracking, as well as specific techniques

for strongly regular graphs such as switching classes are introduced. In [36], a com-

puter search was performed to find all self-complementary strongly regular graphs

with less than 54 vertices.

4.2 Methodology

The SRG program tries to complete the adjacency matrix of a strongly regular graph

by expanding the entries of its orbit matrix into circulant. submatrices. Let us assume

that C = [cij\ is the orbit matrix of the strongly regular graph corresponding to an

automorphism of order p, and that. B = [Bij} is the adjacency matrix of the strongly

regular graph. The SRG program would expand each non-fixed upper triangular

entry cl:t to all the possible (cp ) circulant matrices Bjj.

After each circulant block B^ is placed into the matrix B, a check would be

applied to see that B does not. violate the properties of strongly regular graphs. This

is the pruning part of the algorithm. We will discuss these checks in more detail later.

Because the adjacency matrix B is symmetric, the lower triangular half of the matrix

is obtained by symmetry.
 64

In order to make the backtrack search flexible for each non-fixed tipper diagonal

entry of C, we associate a time-stamp in the SRG program. The time stamp rep-

resents the order which the entries Cij are expanded into circulant blocks Bij in the

backtrack search.

The program also has the ability to perform isomorph rejection at a specific given

time stamp. It means the user is able to specify at which level of the search tree the

isomorph rejection algorithm should be applied. We usually use isomorph rejection at

the beginning and at the very end of the search. Isomorph rejection is time consuming

and very costly when applied to the middle level where there are many cases.

Another pruning technique that is implemented into the SRG program is the

positive semidefinite test. Whenever a principal submatrix is completed, the SRG

program checks whether or not the corresponding submatrix is positive semidefinite.

As we have shown in Chapter 2, the idempotent matrices E\ and E2, as defined in

Equations 11 and 12, are positive semidefinite. Therefore their principal submatrices

are positive semidefinite as well. This is a strong pruning technique, and has given

us the ability to solve cases which we were not able to complete before using this

pruning technique. The program uses a maximal clique algorithm to find at w
?hich

time stamps a new principal submatrix is completed. Let n be the number of orbits

and let T}J represent the time stamp of the i,j block. Define the graph G(V,E) as

follows:

• V = {L...N};

• uv € E iff Tuu < t, Tvv < t. and Tuv < t.

Each clique in G corresponds to a complete principal submatrix at an arbitrary time

stamp t.

In order to find all strongly regular graphs with parameters (t», k, A, /z) that have

an automorphism group of size divisible by a prime p. one should do the following

procedure:
 65

1. Find all the orbit matrices with p as the non-fixed orbit size for all the possible

fixed points.

2. Run the SRG program for all orbit matrices obtained.

3. Run a final isomorphism test.

4.3 An example

In this section, we show by an example, how the SRG program works and the structure

of its input file. We consider the srg(15, 6,1, 3) for this example, with p = 5, and no

fixed points. After running the orbit matrix program, we find that there are exactly

two orbit matrices as follows:
 3 3^

3 0 3 ,

^3 3 Oj

and
 ^0 3 3^

3 2 1 -

V
3 1 V

For this example, we consider the second matrix.

The description of the input file (Figure 1) is as follows:

Line 1: The parameters v. k. A. fi of the strongly regular graph;

Line 2: Prime p for the size of the non-fixed orbits, and the number of orbits;

Line 3: Orbit sizes (here we have three orbits of size 5);

Lines 4-6: The orbit matrix:

Lines 7-9: The time stamps. Please note that since Tij = Tji, only the upper trian-

gular part of the matrix is required:

Line 10: The inverse probability of going into each backtrack level (this can be used

either for a random search or estimation):

We ran the program to get a snap shot at t — 2. At time stamp t = 2, two partial

solutions B\ and B2 were found.

Since Bj is isomorphic to Bo. and we have isomorph rejection at the time stamp

t = 2. the second solution B2 would be rejected.

We finisher! the run to see how many strongly regular graphs were found. This is

The last part of the output shows the size of the backtrack search tree. From the

output, we can see that at time stamp t = 1 there is one partial solution, at time

stamp t = 2 there are two solutions, but one is rejected by the isomorphism test.

At time stamp t = 3 there are ten partial solutions and the isomorphism test is not

performed. At time stamp t = 6 there are 25 solutions, but only 1 non-isomorphic

solution.

4.4 Correctness tests

In order to make sure that the SRG program works correctly, we performed some tests.

The first test was running the program on a few small cases that could be verified

by hand. We also compared our results with the results from other people. Since

the chance of getting exactly the same result, from different algorithms and different,

implementations is very small, we can conclude, with a high level of confidence, that

the SRG program is correct.

One of the test cases that we used was the srg(36.14,4,6). The complete enu-

meration of this case has been done by McKay and Spence in [38]. There are 180

strongly regular graphs with the above parameters which can be downloaded from

£'http://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~es/srgraphs.html''.

We ran the SRG program for all the possible orbit sizes to compare our results to

the results of McKay and Spence. The SRG program found 152 srg(36,14,4, 6) with

non-trivial automorphism groups.

Table 4 shows the statistics on the number of strongly regular graphs found by

Brendan McKay and Edward Spence. and the strongly regular graphs found by the

SRG program. The results are exactly the same except for the asymmetric graphs,

which the SRG program is not designed to find. Since it is very unlikely to get the

same results randomly, this test shows us that the SRG program works correctly

Another test that was done can be found in Section 4.6.2.

4.5 Estimations

Since the running time of most of the combinatorial search algorithms, as well as the

SRG program, are not polynomial, it is very important to hav e an estimation of the

running time of the program before starting the exhaustive search.

Donald Knuth in [29], showed, for the first time, a simple method for estimating

the size of the search tree of a backtrack algorithm. Let. us assume that the level i in

a search tree is the set of all nodes with distance ? to the root. In Knuth s method.

71

a random path P = PQP\ ... PN from the root of the search tree to one of the leaves

is taken. Let Q be the number of children of P, in the search tree. Then an estimate

of the number of nodes at level i is calculated as follow:

Ei — c'oc'i... c*i_i- (42)

An estimate of the size of the search tree is calculated as follows:

E = 1 + C0 + C0Ci + C0CiC2 H b C0C1C2 • • • cn_ 1.  (43)

Under the assumption that all children of a node have equal probability of being

chosen, Donald Knuth in [29] proved that the expected value of E in Equation 43 is

equal to the size of the search tree. Therefore if we compute E for various times and

calculate the average, we can get a good estimation of the size of the backtrack tree.

For more information about backtracking, backtrack search tree, and the Knuth's

method, refer to [30].

In the SRG program, we applied a method, similar to the Knuth's method, to

estimate the size of the search tree. This method has some advantages to the Knuth's

method which will be explained later.

We assign the probabilities pt to each level of the backtrack tree. In the backtrack

search, if we are at a node X at level I, we visit each child of X with probability p,-.

If all pi s are equal to 1, we visit all the nodes of the backtrack search tree, thus we

do a complete exhaustive search. Therefore by the choice of pi, we can do either a

complete search, or a random search using the same program. If we do a random

search, we calculate the estimated number of nodes at each level of the backtrack

search using a recursive method. Let X be a node of the backtrack search tree at.

level T that, has been visited in our random search. Let C(X) be all the children of X

that have been visited in the random search. Define:

1  if i = t.

£i(X) = 0  if?' < t.  (44)

YlveCiX)
 £I(
y)PI Otherwise.

72

Define
 Ei = £(ROOT),

then Ei is the estimated number of nodes at each level i, and Yhi Ei is the estimated

number of all the nodes of the backtrack search.

This method fits perfectly into the backtrack program since it is recursive. We

calculate £i(X) whenever we visit a node X in the backtrack search. The proof of this

method is similar to the proof of the Knuth's method. For the proof of the Knuth's

method refer to [30, page 117].

If we do the complete search, then Ei would be the exact number of nodes at level

i. In this method, we have control over the choice of the probabilities p,. We can

visit the nodes at some levels, especially the levels near the root and near the leaves,

more often than other levels of the backtrack search. This would gives us a better

estimation of the size of the backtrack search.

4.6 Results

In this section, we provide all the results of running the genOrbit and the SRG

program. We divided the results into two subsections. One section is related to

the strongly regular graphs whose existence or non-existence is unknown. The other

section provides the results about the strongly regular graphs whose existence is

known, but there has not been a complete classification performed.

4.6.1 Results on unknown strongly regular graphs

In this section, we are investigating the strongly regular graphs whose existence is un-

known. We obtained the list of these strongly regular graphs from the CRC handbook

of combinatorial designs [11].

The details of all the computer runs on these graphs can be found in Appendix

A.

4.6.2 Results on known strongly regular graphs

We have used the SRG program on parameter sets where there is a strongly regular

graph known, for three reason:

1. To test the SRG program;

2. To find new strongly regular graph that are not isomorphic to any of the known

ones;

3. To build a database of strongly regular graphs with non-trivial automorphisms.

One of the strongly regular graphs that we have studied is srg(49,18, 7, 6). Using

our computer program, we have generated all srg(49,18, 7,6) which have automor-

phisms of order divisible by 5 or 7.

It is mentioned in [11] that all known srg(49.18, 7,6) are either from OA(7. 3) or

Pasechnik(7).

Table 5: Results summery on the automorphism groups of unknown strongly regular
graphs

We have reviewed both of the above constructions in Chapter 2. OA(7, 3) is

equivalent to a Latin square of order 7. According to [11] there are exactly 147 Latin

squares of order 7. We have obtained all the non-isomorphic Latin squares of order

7 from Professor Brendan McKay's webpage at

<f http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/latin.html

We generated all the strongly regular graphs obtained from these 147 Latin squares,

and compared them to our own results. Table 6 shows the automorphism group size

statistics of all the strongly regular graphs obtained from Latin squares of order 7.

It is mentioned in [11] that all known srg(49,18, 7. 6) are either obtained from

Latin squares or from the Pasechnik method. We wrote a computer program to find

It can be seen by hand calculations that there is exactly one skew symmetric

Hadamard matrix of order 8 up to isomorphism which is the following:

There are two srg(49,18, 7, 6) that can be obtained from the matrix II above

by the Pasechnik method. We compared these two graphs to the Latin square

srg(49,18, 7, 6). We realised that the two Pasechnik graphs are isomorphic to a

strongly regular graph with automorphism group of size 1764 which can be obtained

from a Latin square.

Table 7 shows all the strongly regular graphs with automorphism group of size

divisible by 5 and 7.

We compared the output of our program for p = 5 and p = 7 to all srg(49,18, 7,6)

from Latin squares of order 7 and obtained the following two important conclusions:

• All Latin square srg(49.18, 7, 6) which had automorphism orders divisible by 5

and 7 were found by the SRG program, which is a strong correctness test of our

program.

• We have found 6 new strongly regular graphs that were not known before. The

graphs can be found in Appendix B.

Chapter 5

Partial geometries

5.1 Introduction

Theorem 2.29 on page 41 shows that the point graph of a partial geometry is strongly

regular. Since the line graph of a partial geometry is the point graph of its dual,

the line graph is also strongly regular. Table 2 on page 8 shows some unknown

partial geometries, and the parameters of their associated point and line graphs.

It is tempting to construct, partial geometries from their associated strongly regular

graphs. In this chapter, we develop the theory of orbit matrices for partial geometries,

and give some preliminary results.

5.2 Automorphisms of partial geometries

Let A be the incidence matrix of a partial geometry pg(s, t, a) and let B the adjacency

matrix of the associated point graph. Equation 23 gives

B = AA
T - (t + 1 )A.

An automorphism of A is a pair of permutation matrices P and Q such that.

PAQ = A.

79

Here P permutes the rows (points) and Q the columns (lines). We have

PBP
T = P(AA
t - (f + 1 )I)P
T

= PAA
TP
t - [t + 1)1

= PAQQ
TA
TP
T - {T + 1)/

= AA
T-(T + l)I

= B.

Therefore, P is the automorphism of the point graph. Similarly Q is the automor-

phism of the line graph. One should note that an automorphism of the point or line

graph need not be an automorphism of the partial geometry. For example, when

a = 5 + 1, the partial geometry is a 2 — (v, s + 1,1) design. The point graph is a

complete graph and any permutation is an automorphism of the complete graph, but

not necessarily an automorphism of the design.

We next see how the assumption of the existence of a non-trivial automorphism

can help to reduce the size of the search for possible point and line graphs of a partial

geometry. Later on, we shall also see how the automorphism can be used to find a

partial geometry, given a line graph.

5.3 Orbit matrices for partial geometries

Once we have an orbit matrix C for B, we can find the possible orbit matrices of

A. Assume the columns of A are in orbits of size mi, m-2,..., rn,i. For simplicity, we

restrict ourself again to the case that we only have column orbits of size 1 or a prime

P-
 Let v' be the number of columns of A. Let. rjp be the number of column-orbits of

size p and r?i = v' — pr\p be the number of column-orbits of size 1.

Let. CA = [u?J] be the b x d column-sum orbit matrix of A and CAA
 J — [t'jj] be

the 6x 6 column-sum orbit- matrix of AA
T. Using Equation 23. we have

CAAT = C+{ t + l)J . (45 )

80

Since the row sum is t + 1, we have

d  = t+ 1.  (46)

Checking the column sum, we get
 b
J2 Ui j = s + l. (47)
i=1

Let. M = diag(mi, m2,..., ma)- Using a method similar to the one in Lemma 3.1,

one can show that

where the (i, j)-t h entry of SAAr is the sum of all the entries in the («, j)-t h block of

the matrix AA
r. which is in fact, equal to VijUj. Since M is a diagonal matrix, using

Equation 48, we have  d

5 3 UikU]kmk = VijUj. (49)
k=l
More specifically, when i = j, Equation 49 implies

d

5 3 "m-
7"/.- " (50)
k=I

Using Equations 46 and 50, we define the fixed and non-fixed prototypes for the

matrix CA , in a way similar to the prototypes for the matrix C.

Consider an arbitrary fixed row r of CA . Let V>Q and W\ be the number of zeros

and ones, respectively, on the fixed columns of row r. Let ,?0 tuid zi be the number

of zeros and ones, respectively, on the non-fixed columns of row r. Since the number

of fixed columns is 771, we have w0 + v>i = rft. Similarly we have 20 + 2: = VP- Since

the row sum of the matrix A is equal to t + 1, we have

w 1 + pz\ = t + 1.

Thus, we have the following set. of equations:

C-AMC
T
A = SAAT.  (48)

U'o + Wi  = m-

z 0 +21 — rjp.  (51)

+ pz\ = f + 1.

81

We define a Fixed Prototype as a non-negative integer solution to these linear equa-

tions.

Now consider an arbitrary non-fixed row r of CA- The possible values of the fixed

column entries of row r are either 0 or p. The possible values of the non-fixed column

entries of row r can be 0,1,... , p. Let w0 and wp be the number of zeros and p's on the

fixed columns of row r. Let Zi, i = 0,1,.. . be the number of i's on the non-fixed

columns of row r. Similar to the situation with fixed rows, we have U>q + wp = rji and

XX=o
 zi
 = rh- Also- since the row sum of A is equal to t + 1, by counting we have

wp + izi = t + 1. Using Equation 50, we have

p
p
2wp + i
2pzi = vrrnr = pvrr = p(crr + t + 1).
J=1

Thus, we have the following set of equations:

wo + wp = r/).

z0 + Z! + z2 + z3 + ••• + zp =rjp,  (52)

wp + z\ + 2Z2 4- 3z3 + • • • + pzp = t, + 1,

pwp + zj + iz2 + 9z3 + ••• + p
2zp = crr + t + l.

We define a Non-Fixed Prototype as a non-negative integer solution to those linear

equations.

After calculating the prototypes, the backtrack search for finding the matrix C'A

is similar to the backtrack algorithm for finding C. The only difference is that for CA

we should also consider the column sum which is equal to s + 1.

After the matrix CA is found, one can then apply a backtrack search to try to find

the incidence matrix A of the partial geometry.

Note that the column orbits of the incidence matrix ,4 are the orbits of the vertices

of the line graph for the partial geometry. Thus, we only need to consider those

column orbit sizes for which there exist an orbit matrix for the line graph with the

corresponding orbit sizes.

Next, we consider an example.
 82

Exampl e 10. In this example, we consider the pg(2,2,1). Its point graph is an

srg(15,6.1,3). Assume p = 3 and assume that, for the point graph, there are three

orbits of size one and four orbits of size three. Therefore <p = 3, </' = 4, n\ — =

n3 = 1 and n4 = n 5 = n 6 = n7 = 3. We have found the orbit matrix for the strongly-

regular graph with the same automorphism in Example 9, which is as follows up to

isomorphism:
 /

C =
 0  0  0  0  0  1  1

0  0  0  0  1  0  1

0  0  0  1  0  0  1

0  0  3  0  2  2  1

0  3  0  2  0  2  1

3  0  0  2  2  0  1

3  3  3  1  1  1  0

Using Equation 45, we have:

CAAT =
 V CO 0  0  0  0  1  1

0  3  0  0  1  0  1

0  0  3  1  0  0  1

0  0  3  3  2  2  1

0  3  0  2  3  2  1

3  0  0  2  2  3  1

3  3  3  1  1  1  3

Now, we try to construct the orbit matrix of A. Assume that the desired partial

geometry has 5 column orbits of size 3, that is, mi = m.2 = m-i = ni\ = m^ = 3.

Therefore r)i = 0 and 773 = 5.

Now, we calculate the prototypes for CA- First, we calculate the fixed prototype

83

using Equation 51. We have the following set of equations:

w0 + w\ = 0,

zo + 21 =5 , (53)

w\ + 3zi = 3.

The only non-negative integer solution to the set of equations above is:

(u>o,Wi, 20,21) = (0,0,4,1).

So there are exactly four 0's and one 1 on each fixed row of the matrix CA-

Now, we consider the non-fixed prototypes, we have:

Wo + W3 = 0,

20 + 2 a + z2 + 2 3 = 5,  (54)

w 3 + z\ + 2z2 + 323 = 3,

3U>3 + ZI + 4 Z2 + 923 = Crr + 3.

In this example, for the non-fixed rows r, crr = 0. The only non-negative integer

solution to the set of equations above is:

(w0, li'3. Z0, Z\, z2, 23 ) = (0, 0, 2, 3,0, 0).

So there are exactly two 0's and three l's on each non-fixed row of the matrix CA-

Now, we try to construct the matrix CA using the information from the prototypes.

The first row is [10000] up to isomorphism. Using Equation 49. we can see that

5
T ; UuU2i = 0.

i=1

One can see, up to isomorphism, the second row is [01000]; the third row is [00100];

and so on. Therefore, the only possible choice for CA up to isomorphism is the

84

following:
 / 1 0 0 0 0 ^

0 0 1 0 0

CA= 0 0 11 1

0 1 0 1 1

1 0 0 1 1

111 0 0

Using this orbit matrix, a BDX backtrack algorithm finds the following partial geom-

5.4 Methodology

When searching for partial geometries, we assume that the partial geometry has an

automorphism group of prime order p.

Depending on the parameters of the partial geometry, the construction process

will be one of the following processes, or the combination of both.

Process 1:

1. Construct the orbit matrices of the point and/or line graph.

2. Construct the orbit matrices of the partial geometry from the orbit matrices of

the point graph.

3. Construct the partial geometry from its orbit matrices.

Process 2:
 87

1. Construct the orbit matrices of the point and/or line graph.

2. Construct the point and/or line graph.

3. Construct the partial geometry from its point and/or line graph.

We have implemented most of the programs required for Process 1 and Process 2.

5.5 Results

We have some preliminary results on pg(6.10. 5). The point graph of a pg(6,10, 5) is

an srg(91.66,45, 55), which is the unique T(14).

It can be seen that the automorphism group of T(14) is the symmetric group

514, since any permutation on the ground set keeps the graph unchanged. We are

interested to know if T(14) is geometric or not. This would show whether a pg(6,10,5)

exists or does not exist. Using Lemma 2.30 it would be enough to check whether this

graph is the point graph of a pls(6.10) or not.

The prime factors of 14!, the size of Aut(T(14)), are 2,3, 5, 7,11, and 13. We have

finished the search for p = 5,7.11 and 13. and no partial geometry was found for

those group sizes. For p = 11 and p = 13 the computation time was low, about two

hours CPU time, but for p = 7 and p = 5 the amount of computation was very large.

We used more than 100 machines to finish the task in a reasonable amount of time.

Chapter 6

Conclusion

In this chapter we summaries the contributions of this thesis and talk about the

possible future work.

6.1 Contribution

In this thesis, we studied the properties of strongly regular graphs and their auto-

morphism groups.

The summary of the contributions in this thesis is as follows:

1. We implemented the theory of orbit matrices for strongly regular graphs for the

first time which is a new theory in this field. We have implemented a computer

program that generates all the orbit matrices for the given parameters and an

automorphism.

2. Using orbit matrices we implemented an exhaustive search algorithm for finding

strongly regular graphs. Using orbit matrices in our algorithm helps us to reduce

the complexity as well as the required time of the algorithm.

3. Using our program we eliminated many primes as possible divisors of the order

of the automorphism group of many unknown strongly regular graphs.

89

4. We found some new strongly regular graphs that are not isomorphic to any

known ones.

5. We found several upper bounds on the number of fixed points (p of the auto-

morphism of strongly regular graphs.

6. We have developed the theory of orbit matrices for partial geometries.

6.2 Future work

We have run the SRG program for several parameter sets, but because of time limi-

tation, we were not able to do the search for other parameter sets. For future work,

we can improve the program so that it can handle more parameter sets.

We have obtained some preliminary results on partial geometries. We can use the

orbit matrix program for partial geometries to investigate their automorphisms and

their existence.

We have found some upper bounds on the number of fixed points of an automor-

phism of a strongly regular graph. As future work, we can try to lower these upper

bounds.

Appendix A

Search for unknown strongly

regular graphs with less that 100

vertices

In this appendix, we provide the details of results of computer runs for strongly

regular graphs. There is a table for each parameter set with fewer than one hundred

vertices. The first row of each table corresponds to the smallest prime for which we

were able to run the program. All subsequent rows correspond to other larger possible

primes. The second column corresponds to the number of possible fixed points for

each prime p in the first column. The third column corresponds to the number of

orbit matrices found for the given number of fixed points. If there exist orbit matrices,

then we run the SRG program for those orbit matrices; the fourth column shows the

number of strongly regular graphs found for the orbit matrices. If there is a in

the table, it means that we have not found any solutions and we were not able to

finish the program due to time constraints. Under the note column, we provide more

information about the specific case. For example, if we have done an estimation for

the particular case, it would be given in this column. We have found some upper

bounds in this thesis on the number of fixed points an automorphism of a strongly

regular graph can have. We refer to these upper bounds in the note column to shows

96

why we do not need to check for bigger numbers of fixed points. If there is an "nnfp"

in the note column, it means that there is no non-fixed prototype for that number of

fixed points. By Theorem 3.4 there would be no more non-fixed prototypes for any

larger number of fixed points.
