Amply regular graph
We consider undirected graphs without loops or multiple edges.
Let Γ be a graph. For vertex a of Γ the subgraph
Γi(a) = {b |d(a, b) = i} is called i-neighboorhod of a in Γ. We
set [a] = Γ1(a), a⊥ = {a} ∪ [a].

The degree of a vertex a of Γ is the number of vertices in [a]. Γ
is called regular of degree k, if the degree of any its vertex is
equal k. Γ is called amply regular with parameters (v, k, λ, µ) if
Γ is regular of degree k on v vertices, and |[u] ∩ [w]| is equal λ, if
u is adjacent to w, is equal µ, if d(u, w) = 2. Amply regular
graph of diameter 2 is called strongly regular.

Some strongly regular graphs

Let X be a set of power m. Triangular graph T (m) has the
vertex set (X
2 ) = {{u, w} | u, w ∈ X, u ̸= w} and {u, w} is
adjacent to {x, y}, if and only if |{u, w} ∩ {x, y}| = 1.

Let Y be a set of power n. Grid graph m × n has the vertex set
X × Y and (x1, y1) is adjacent to (x2, y2), if and only if x1 = x2
or y1 = y2.

Distance-regular graph

Let u, w ∈ Γ such that d(u, w) = i. By bi(u, w) (by ci(u, w)) we
denote the number of vertices in Γi+1(u) ∩ [b] (in Γi−1(u) ∩ [b]).
The graph Γ with diameter d is called distance-regular with
intersection array {b0, b1, ..., bd−1; c1, ..., cd} if for every
i ∈ {0, ..., d} the values bi = bi(u, w) and ci = ci(u, w) do not
depend on the choice of vertices u, w at distance i. A
distance-regular graph with diameter 2 is strongly regular with
parameters (v, k, λ, µ), where v is the number of vertices of the
graph, k = b0, λ = k − b1 − 1 and µ = c2.

Automorphism

Let g be an automorphism of a graph Γ. Denote by αi(g) the
number of vertices u such that d(u, ug) = i and by Fix(g) the
subgraph {a ∈ Γ | ag = a}.

Intersection numbers
Let Γ be a distance-regular graph of diameter d on v vertices.
Let us consider the symmetric association scheme (X, R) with d
classes, where X is the set of vertices of Γ and
Ri = {(u, w) ∈ X 2 | d(u, w) = i}. For vertex u ∈ X set
ki = |Γi(u)|. Let Ai be the adjacency matrix of the graph Γi,
wich is corresponding to the relation Ri. Then AiAj = ∑ pl
ijAl
for some integer numbers pl
ij ≥ 0, which are called the
intersection numbers. Note that pl
ij = |Γi(u) ∩ Γj(w)| for any
vertices u, w with d(u, w) = l.

Eigenmatrices

Let Pi be the matrix in which in the (j, l) entry there is pl
ij.
Then the eigenvalues k = p1(0), ..., p1(d) of the matrix P1 are
eigenvalues of Γ with multiplicities m0 = 1, ..., md. Note that the
matrix Pi is the value of some integer polynom of P1, so the
ordering of eigenvalues of the matrix P1 gives the ordering of
eigenvalues of Pi. The matrices P and Q with (i, j) entry pj(i)
and Qji = mjpi(j)/ki are called the ﬁrst and the second
eigenmatrix of Γ and P Q = QP = vI holds, where I is the
identity matrix of order d + 1.

Proposition 1 [1, Theorem 17.12]

Let uj and wj be the left and the right eigenvectors of matrix
P1 aﬀording eigenvalue p1(j) and having the ﬁrst coordinate 1.
Then the multiplicity mj of the eigenvalue p1(j) is equal
v/⟨uj, wj⟩.

Character

In fact, from the proof of the Theorem 17.12 we have that wj
are the columns of the matrix P and mjuj are the rows of the
matrix Q.

The permutation representation of the group G ≤ Aut(Γ) on the
vertex set of Γ naturally gives the matrix representation ψ of G
in GL(v, C). The space Cv is the orthogonal direct sum of the
eigenspaces W0, W1, ..., Wd of the adjacency matrix A1 of Γ. For
every g ∈ G we have ψ(g)A1 = A1ψ(g), so the subspace Wi is
ψ(G)-invariant. Let χi be a character of the representation ψWi.
Then for g ∈ G we obtain
 [2,§3.7]

χi(g) = v−1 ∑d
j=0 Qijαj(g), where αj(g) is the numbers of
vertices x of X such that d(x, xg) = j.

A.A. Makhnev Graphs and automorphisms

t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 11 lit

Note that the value of character is an integer algebraic number,
and if the numbers Qij are rational then χi(g) is integer.
The Higman method was published in [2]. And in [2] this
method was applied only to involutive automorphisms of
strongly regular graph with parameters (3250,57,0,1).

Automorphisms of srg

If g is an automorphism of a strongly regular graph Γ, then
either Γ has parameters k = 2µ and λ = µ − 1 (a conference
graph), or χi(g) is integer.
P. Cameron noted that the main diﬃculte in the Higman
method is the calculation of parameters αj(g). But in the class
of graphs without triangles, for every automorphism f of ofder 3
we obtaine α1(f ) = 0. Apart from, the structure of subgraphs of
ﬁxed points of automorphism is strongly restricted in graphs
with small λ and µ. For example, M. Aschbacher noted that
nonempty subgraph of ﬁxed points of automorphism of strongly
regular Moore graph (graph with λ = 0 and µ = 1) is Moore
graph or star.
The common properties of strongly regular graphs are in

Lemma 1
Let Γ be a strongly regular graph with parameters (v, k, λ, µ).
Then v − k − 1 = k(k − λ − 1)/µ and one of the following holds:

1 k = 2µ, λ = µ − 1 and v = 4µ + 1 is the sum of two squares
of some integers;

2 (λ − µ)2 + 4(k − µ) is the square of some positive integer n,
and Γ has spectrum k1, rf , sv−f −1, where r = (λ − µ + n)/2,
s = (λ − µ − n)/2 and f = (s + 1)k(s − k)/(nµ).

Involutive automorphisms
A. Makhnev and I. Minakova investigated involutive
automorphisms of strongly regular graph with parameters
(99, 14, 1, 2).

Let t be an involutive automorphisms of strongly regular graph
with parameters (v, k, 1, 2), Ω = Fix(t). If a ∈ Ω, b ∈ Ω − a⊥,
then [a] ∩ [b] = {u, ut} is a 2-coclique. If u ∈ [a] − Ω and {u, ut}
is a 2-coclique, then [u] ∩ [ut] = {a, b} and b ∈ Ω − a⊥. So
|Ω| = 1 + |Ω(a)| + 2l, where l  is the number of t-orbits of size
2 on the edges in [a].

Proposition 2

Let Γ be a strongly regular graph with parameters (99, 14, 1, 2),
having involutive automorphism t. Then Fix(t) is one of the
following graphs:

1 one-vertex graph;

2 triangle;

3 three isolated triangles;

4 vertex and two isolated triangles;

5 four isolated vertices and triangle;

Only in the case (1) the value χ2(t) is integer. Consider, for
example, the case, when Fix(t) is the union of 4-coclique and
triangle. Then t has 3 orbits of size 2 on the edges in [a], if a is
isolated in Fix(t) and t has 2 orbits of size 2 on the edges in [b],
if b belongs to triangle of Fix(t), so α1(t) = 4 · 2 + 3 · 4 = 20 and
χ2(t) = (28 + 20 − 18)/7, a contradiction.

H. Wilbrink [4] proved that Γ does not admit an automorphism

Let Γ be a strongly regular graph with parameters (v, k, 0, 2).

k1, (w − 1)f , −(w + 1)v−f −1, where
f = w(w2 + 1)(w2 + w + 2)/(4w), so w is not divided by 4.

Let Γ be a strongly regular graph with parameters

1 p = 2, either Ω is the empty graph, 14-coclique, connected

3 p = 11 and Ω is an empty graph;

Krein graphs

Krein conditions
Let strongly regular graph Γ with parameters (v, k, λ, µ) have
eigenvalues k, r, s. If graphs Γ and ¯Γ are connected then the
next unequalities (Krein conditions) hold:
(1) (r + 1)(k + r + 2rs) ≤ (k + r)(s + 1)2 and
(2) (s + 1)(k + s + 2rs) ≤ (k + s)(r + 1)2.

Γ is called Krein graph, if we have equality in (1) or in (2). It is
interesting that in Krein graph the ﬁrst and the second
neighboorhods of any vertex are strongly regular. Krein graph
without triangles has parameters
((r2 + 3r)2, r3 + 3r2 + r, 0, r2 + r) and we denote this graph as
Kre(r). For each r = 1, 2 there is the unique graph Kre(r) 
the Clebsh graph and the Higman-Sims graph respectively. By

intersect in at most one point), diameter of collinearity graph Γ

point with minimal distance of a in Γ. Near 2n-gon is called
generalized 2n-gon, if every two point u, w with dΓ(u, w) < n
belongs to the unique geodesic way in Γ from u to w.
Generalized 2n-gon of order (s, t) is called thick, if s > 1 and

By substitution α2(g) + α3(g) = 1755 − α0(g) − α1(g) − α4(g),
we have
 χ3(g) = (24α0(g) − 8α1(g) − α4(g))/64 + 135/8.

Finally,
χ4(g) = 39/1755(2α0(g) − α1(g) + α2(g)/2 − α3(g)/4 + α4(g)/8).
By substitution α4(g) = 1755 − α0(g) − α1(g) − α2(g) − α3(g),
we have

χ4(g) = (5α0(g) − 3α1(g) + α2(g) − α3(g))/120 + 39/8.

Let us prove, for example, that if Fix(g) is an empty graph,
then p ̸= 5.
Let p = 5. Then αi(g) is divided by 5 and α0(g) = α1(g) = 0. As
χ3(g) = (24α0(g) − 8α1(g) − α4(g))/64 + 135/8 is integer, then
α4(g) = 40r and 5(r − 3) is divided by 8. So r = 8r′ + 3 is odd.
As χ4(g) = (5α0(g) − 3α1(g) + α2(g) − α3(g))/120 + 39/8 is
integer, then α2(g) = 5s, α3(g) = 5u, s − u is divided by 3 and
(s − u)/3 − 1 is divided by 8. So s − u = 3(8y + 1). Further,∑ αi(g) = 5s + 5u + 40r = 1755, so
s + u = 351 − 8r = 2u + 24y + 3 and u = 174 − 12y − 4r.
As χ2(g) = (35α0(g) + 3α1(g) − 5α2(g) − α3(g))/96 + 325/32 is
integer, then (5s + u)/3 − 1 = 2u + 40y + 4 is divided by 32.
Thus, u + 20y + 2 = 176 + 8y − 4r is divided by 16, a
contradiction with r is odd.

Generalized hexagon

I. Belousov and A. Makhnev investigated automorphisms of
distance-regular graph with intersection array
{84, 81, 81; 1, 1, 28} on 26572 vertices. This graph is the
collinearity graph of generalized hexagon GH(3, 27) and does
not contain m-circles for 4 ≤ m ≤ 5. It is known the existence of
thick generalized hexagon only for {s, t} = {q, q} or
{s, t} = {q, q3}, where q = pl, p is a prime number. Apart from,
GH(q, q) corresponds to the building of the group G2(q) and
GH(q, q3) corresponds to the building of the group 3D4(q).

It is known (see [12]), that there is a unique generalized hexagon

Next two lemmas have independent interest.

Lemma 2
Let Γ be a distance-regular graph with intersection array
{q(q3 + 1), q4, q4; 1, 1, q3 + 1}. If Γ contains proper subgraph ∆
such that ∆ is the collinearity graph of generalized hexagon of
order (q, t), then t ≤ q.

Proof
Let Γ contain proper subgraph ∆ such that ∆ is the collinearity
graph of generalized hexagon of order (q, t). Then the number
vertices of ∆ is equal v′ = (q + 1)(q2t2 + qt + 1), the degree of
the graph ∆ is k′ = q(t + 1) and the number of edges between ∆
and Γ − ∆ is equal v′(k − k′) = (q + 1)(q2t2 + qt + 1)q(q3 − t).
As every vertex of Γ − ∆ is adjacent to at most one vertex of ∆,
then v = (q + 1)(q8 + q4 + 1) and v ≥ v′ + v′(k − k′), so
t3 − q3t2 − q2t + q5 = (t − q)(t + q)(t − q3) ≥ 0. Hence t ≤ q.

Lemma 3
Let Γ be a distance-regular graph with intersection array
{q(q3 + 1), q4, q4; 1, 1, q3 + 1}, g be an element of prime order p
of Aut(Γ) and Ω = Fix(g) is nonempty subgraph. Then:

1 if Ω is nonconnected, then Ω is coclique, and if p > q, then
p divides q3 + 1;

2 if Ω is connected and p > q, then Ω is the collinearity graph
of generalized hexagon of order (q, t), and either t = 1, or
the number qt is the square, q ≤ t3 and t ≤ q.

Proof
Let Ω be a nonconnected subgraph. Then vertices from distinct
connected components of Ω are at the distance 3 in Γ. Let a, b
are adjacent in Ω and c belongs to other connected component
of Ω. By deﬁnition of generalized hexagon the clique a⊥ ∩ b⊥

contains the unique vertex e with d(c, e) = 2. The contradiction
with d ∈ Ω.
 A.A. Makhnev Graphs and automorphisms

t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 11 lit

Hence, Ω is a coclique.
Let p > q. Then k = q(q3 + 1), so p devides q3 + 1. The
statement (1) is proved.
Let Ω be connected and p > q. Consider two adjacent vertices
a, b. Then the clique L = a⊥ ∩ b⊥ is a subset of Ω. Further g
acts on the set of q3 maximal cliques from b⊥ diﬀerent of L and
ﬁxes one more clique L1 in this set. For c ∈ L1 − {b} we get the
maximal clique L2 from c⊥, ﬁxed by g.
Note that every two vertices a, e ∈ Ω, that are antipodal in Γ,
have the same degree in Ω. By connectivity Ω there is the vertex
b ∈ Ω(a) ∩ Γ2(e) such that the clique a⊥ ∩ b⊥ is a subset in Ω
and contains the unique vertex c with d(c, e) = 2. Further for
every vertex b ∈ Ω(a) ∩ Γ2(e) there is a unique vertex c adjacent
with b from Ω(d) ∩ Γ2(a) and c⊥ ∩ e⊥ ⊂ Ω. As µ = 1, so distinct
vertices b, b′ ∈ Ω(a) ∩ Γ2(e) correspond to distinct vertices c, c′

and |Ω(a)| = |Ω(e)|.

t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 11 lit

We have p1
33 = q8(q − 1), so for adjacent vertices a, b of Ω there
is a vertex e ∈ Ω such that d(a, e) = d(b, e) = 3. Hence Ω is
regular graph. Thus Ω is the collinearity graph of near 2d-gon
with d = 3, and c2(Ω) = 1. So Ω is the collinearity graph of
generalized hexagon of order (q, t), and by theorem 6.5.1 of [10]
either t = 1, or the number qt is the square, q ≤ t3 and t < q3.
By Lemma 2 we have t ≤ q.

Graphs with block-designs

graphs with diameter d ≥ 3, such that for some vertex a ∈ Γ the
pair (Γd(a), Γd−1(a)) is a 2-(V, K, Λ) design [14]. In this case
Γd(a) is clique, coclique or strongly regular graph with
parameters (v′ = V, k′ = k − R, λ′ = λ − Λ, µ′ = µ − Λ).
For distance-regular graphs with diameter d ≥ 3, such that for
every vertex a ∈ Γ the pair (Γd(a), Γd−1(a)) is a 2-design can be
wright the following.

Conjecture Σ
Let Γ be a distance-regular graphs with diameter d, such that

This Conjecture is based on the fact that in the list of feasible
arrays in [10] only two arrays {60, 45, 8; 1, 12, 50} and
{49, 36, 8; 1, 6, 42} correspond to graphs satisfying conditions of
the Conjecture Σ. In the ﬁrst case Γ3(a) is 6 × 6-grid, and in the
second case Γ3(a) is the union of seven isolated 8-cliques. It is
proved in [14] that a distance-regular graph with intersection
array {60, 45, 8; 1, 12, 50} contains a vertex x such that Γ3(x) is
not 6 × 6-grid. In the second case the pair (Γ3(a), Γ2(a)) is a
2-(V, K, Λ) design, where V = 56, K = 8 and Λ = 42 · 7/55.

In [15] it is investigated automorphisms of distance-regular
graph with intersection array {60, 45, 8; 1, 12, 50}. This graph
have the spectrum 601, 1445, 0207, −1069 and is Q-polinomial.

Antipodality
Let Γ be a graph of diameter d. Γ is called antipodal graph, if
{(u, w) | d(u, w) ∈ {0, d}} is equivalence relation on the vertex
set of Γ. The graph Γ′ with the set of antipodal classes of Γ as
the vertex set and u′ is adjacent to w′ iﬀ there exist u ∈ u′, that

Covers of srg(81,20,1,6)

Wenbin Guo, A. Makhnev and D. Paduchikh investigated
automorphisms of a distance-regular r-covers Γ of the strongly
regular graph with parameters (81,20,1,6). It is known that
there exists a unique strongly regular graph with this
parameters. If d(Γ) = 5 then Γ has the intersection array
{20, 18, t(r − 1), 6, 1; 1, 6, t, 18, 20} and
c2 ≤ t ≤ min{b1, a2}/(r − 1) (parameters a2, b1, c2 correspond to
the strongly regular graph), so r ≤ 3. If r = 3, then t = 6, 7. If
r = 2, then 6 ≤ t ≤ 14. In any case some eigenvalue of Γ has
nonintegral multiplicity.

Covers with diameter 4
In the case d(Γ) = 4 by Theorem 4.2.11 [10] the graph Γ has
feasible intersection array for r ∈ {2, 3, 6}. If r = 3 then cover
exist (it is the graph on the cosets of ternary Goley code).

Terwilliger graphs

Known graphs
Noncomplete connected graph is called Terwilliger graph, if for
every two vertices u, w at distance 2 the subgraph [u] ∩ [w] is
µ-clique for some constant µ. All of known distance-regular
Terwilliger graph with µ > 1 are locally Moore graphs. A
connected locally pentagon graph is isomorphic to the
icosahedron. There are exactly three connected locally Petersen
graphs [10, theorem 1.16.5]: ¯T (7), Conway-Smith graph (the
unique distance-regular graph with intersection array
{10, 6, 4, 1; 1, 2, 6, 10}) and Doro graph (the unique
distance-regular graph with intersection array {10, 6, 4; 1, 2, 5}).
The existence of locally Hoﬀman-Singleton graphs is unknown.

So

As α2(g) = 1122 − α0(g) − α1 − α3(g), then

χ1(g) = (53α0(g) + 11α1(g) − 2α3(g))/165 − 17/5.

Further, χ2(g) = 1/1122(50α0(g) − α1(g) − α2(g) + 50α3(g). By
