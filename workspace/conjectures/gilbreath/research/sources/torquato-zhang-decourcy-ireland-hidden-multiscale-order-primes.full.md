HIDDEN MULTISCALE ORDER IN THE PRIMES

SALVATORE TORQUATO, GE ZHANG, AND MATTHEW DE COURCY-IRELAND

Abstract. We study the pair correlations between prime numbers in an in-
terval M ≤ p ≤ M + L with M → ∞, L/M → β > 0. By analyzing the
structure factor, we prove, conditionally on the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture
on prime pairs, that the primes are characterized by unanticipated multiscale
order. Speciﬁcally, their limiting structure factor is that of a union of an in-
ﬁnite number of periodic systems and is characterized by dense set of Dirac
delta functions. Primes in dyadic intervals are the ﬁrst examples of what
we call eﬀectively limit-periodic point conﬁgurations. This behavior implies
anomalously suppressed density ﬂuctuations compared to uncorrelated (Pois-
son) systems at large length scales, which is now known as hyperuniformity.
Using a scalar order metric τ calculated from the structure factor, we iden-
tify a transition between the order exhibited when L is comparable to M and
the uncorrelated behavior when L is only logarithmic in M . Our analysis for
the structure factor leads to an algorithm to reconstruct primes in a dyadic
interval with high accuracy.
1. Introduction

While prime numbers are deterministic, by some probabilistic descriptors, they
can be regarded as pseudo-random in nature. Indeed, the primes can be diﬃcult
to distinguish from a random conﬁguration of the same density. For example,
assuming a plausible conjecture, Gallagher proved that the gaps between primes
follow a Poisson distribution [13]. Thus the number of M ≤ X such that there are
exactly N primes in the interval M < p < M + L of length L ∼ λ ln X is given
asymptotically by

# {M ≤ X such that π(M + L) − π(M ) = N } ∼ X e−λλ
N

N ! .

Note that Gallagher’s interest was in short intervals whereas we analyze those in
which the length L is comparable to the lower endpoint M . Our primary observation
is that for these longer intervals, the primes are highly correlated and ordered on
multiple length scales and hence are drastically diﬀerent from a Poisson distribution.
This is demonstrated by the identiﬁcation of sharp peaks in the structure factor of
the primes and by large values of the order parameter τ , both of which we deﬁne
in Section 2. In particular, we use the structure factor to detect a large-scale order
known as hyperuniformity [48], very diﬀerent from the uncorrelated behavior one
sees in short intervals.
To study diﬀerent ranges of primes, it is important to take account of the fact that
primes become increasingly sparse in longer intervals. Let π(x) denote the prime
counting function, which gives the number of primes less than x. According to the
prime number theorem [19], the prime counting function in the large-x asymptotic

limit is given by

(1.1) π(x) ∼ x
ln(x) (x → ∞).

The prime number theorem means that for suﬃciently large x, the probability that a
randomly selected integer not greater than x is prime is very close to 1/ ln(x), which
can be viewed as a position-dependent number density ρ(x) (number of primes up
to x divided by the interval x). This implies that the primes become sparser as x
increases and hence constitute a statistically inhomogeneous set of points that are
located on a subset of the odd integers. This simple observation requires that one
carefully choose the interval over which the primes are sampled and characterized
in order to obtain meaningful results that in general will depend on the chosen
interval. If L is much larger than M , the density 1/ ln(n) drops oﬀ appreciably as
n ranges from M to M + L, and then the system is the very opposite of hyper-
uniform. On the other hand, ln(M + L) = ln(M ) + ln(1 + L/M ) is asymptotic to
ln(M ) as long as L/M is bounded above. In this case, one can treat the primes as
homogeneous with constant density 1/ ln(M ). For this paper, we take L ∼ βM of
the same order as M or sometimes smaller to compare with Gallagher’s regime.

The plausible conjecture Gallagher assumed is a version of the Hardy-Littlewood
m-tuples conjecture (Theorem X1, p. 61 of [20]). If H = (h1, . . . , hm) is a m-tuple
of integers, then the conjecture gives the number of n ≤ X such that all of the
shifts n + h1, . . . , n + hm are prime as

(1.2) # {n ≤ X such that n + hj all prime} ∼ S(H) X
(ln X)m ,

where

(1.3) S(H) = ∏

p
 (
1 − 1
p
 )−m (
1 − νH(p)
p
 )

(1.4) νH(p) = # {distinct hj mod p} .

When m = 1, say H = {h1}, (1.2) simply counts primes less than X (or, strictly,
less than X − h1). In (1.3), since every ν(p) is 1, one has S(H) = 1. Thus the case
m = 1 is the prime number theorem, and it is the only one so far to be proved.
Gallagher used all values of m in order to compare the empirical moments of primes
in short intervals with the moments of the Poisson distribution.
Our study of the structure factor ultimately leads to an equivalent formulation
of the case m = 2. The Hardy-Littlewood constant S(H) can be understood as
a correction to the prediction one would make by imagining that all of the shifts
n + hj are prime independently with probability 1/ ln(X); see [6] and, for this and
other senses in which the random model fails, [38]. To summarize the interpretation,
note that, for each p, (1 − 1/p)
m is the naive chance that each of the shifts would
be indivisible by p. However, these constraints are not independent, and νH(p) is
exactly the number of residue classes modulo p which n must avoid or else one of
the numbers n+hj would have p as a factor. Thus S(H) cancels the incorrect guess
(1 − 1/p)
m and replaces it with the correct (p − ν(H))/p. The argument advanced
by Hardy-Littlewood, which we outline in Appendix A, is however of an altogether
diﬀerent nature.
 HIDDEN MULTISCALE ORDER IN THE PRIMES 3

Probabilistic methods to treat the primes have yielded fruitful insights about
them [15]. Furthermore, there are computationally quick stochastic ways to ﬁnd
large primes [33, 40, 39, 3, 1]. On the other hand, it is known that primes contain
unusual patterns, and hence their distribution is not purely random. Chebyshev
observed (circa 1853) that primes congruent to 3 modulo 4 seem to predominate
over those congruent to 1. Assuming a generalized Riemann hypothesis, Rubinstein
and Sarnak [41] exactly characterized this phenomenon and more general related
results. A computational study on the Goldbach conjecture demonstrates a con-
nection based on a modulo 3 geometry between the set of even integers and the
set of primes [29]. In 1934, Vinogradov proved that every suﬃciently large odd
integer is the sum of three primes [52]. This method has been extended to cover
many other types of patterns [17, 18, 16, 44]. Recently it has been shown that
there are inﬁnitely many pairs of primes with some ﬁnite gap [57] and that primes
with decimal expansion ending in 1 are less likely to be followed by another prime
ending in 1 [36]. There is numerical evidence for patterns in the distribution of
gaps between primes when these are divided into congruence families [31, 7, 53].
The present paper is motivated by certain remarkable properties of the Riemann
zeta function ζ(s), which is a function of a complex variable s that is intimately
related to the primes. The zeta function has many diﬀerent representations, one of
which is the well-known series formula

(1.5) ζ(s) =
 ∞∑

n=1
 1
ns ,

which converges for Re(s) > 1. However, ζ(s) has a unique analytic continuation
to the entire complex plane, excluding the simple pole at s = 1. According to the
Riemann hypothesis, the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function lie along the critical
line s = 1/2 + it with t ∈ R in the complex plane and hence form a one-dimensional
point process. The nontrivial zeros tend to get denser the higher on the critical
line. When the spacings of the zeros are appropriately normalized so that they
can be treated as a homogeneous point process at unity density, the resulting pair
correlation function g2(r) takes on the simple form 1 − sin
2(πr)/(πr)
2 [34]. This
has consequences for the distribution of the primes in short intervals [35]. The
corresponding structure factor S(k) [essentially the Fourier transform of g2(r)] s
given by
 S(k) =
 



 k
2π , 0 ≤ k ≤ 2π

1, k > 2π.
(1.6)

Remarkably, this exactly matches the structure factor of the eigenvalues of a ran-
dom matrix in the Gaussian unitary ensemble [11, 32, 42]; see Fig. 1.1. We see
that structure factor goes to zero linearly in k as wavenumber goes to zero and is
equal to unity for k > 2π. This implies that the normalized Riemann zeros possess
an unusual type of correlated disorder at large length scales known as hyperuni-
formity [48, 47]. A hyperuniform point conﬁguration is one in which S(k) tends
to zero as the wavenumber k tends to zero [48]. In such systems, density ﬂuctua-
tions are anomalously suppressed at very large length scales, a “hidden” order that
imposes strong global structural constraints. All structurally perfect crystals and
quasicrystals are hyperuniform, but typical disordered many-particle systems, in-
cluding gases, liquids, and glasses, are not. Disordered hyperuniform many-particle

systems are exotic states of amorphous matter that have attracted considerable
recent attention [10, 47, 4, 55, 12, 54, 24, 23, 50, 30, 27, 14, 21, 46].

Figure 1.1. Structure factor of the normalized nontrivial zeros
of the Riemann zeta function as a function of the wavenumber [cf.
(1.6)]. This is a special case of a hyperuniform point conﬁgura-
tion [48, 47].

Because information about the primes can in principle be deduced from informa-
tion about the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function via explicit formulas [8, 45, 22],
one might expect the primes to encode hyperuniform correlations seen in the Rie-
mann zeros. For example, von Mangoldt’s explicit formula for a weighted counting
function ψ(x) = ∑

pn<x ln(p) is given by

(1.7) ψ(x) = x − ∑

−2) − ln(2π),

for x > 1 and x not a prime or prime power (where ψ(x) would have a jump
discontinuity). Here, 1/2 + iγ denotes a nontrivial zero of ζ(s), meaning that
it lies in the critical strip 0 < Re(s) < 1. Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis,
γ is real and the zeros thus form a one-dimensional point process. In any case,
allowing for complex γ, the explicit formula applies unconditionally. The trivial
zeros −2, −4, −6, . . . contribute ln(1 − x
−2). The explicit formula may be thought
of as a Mellin transform of the prime numbers. The structure factor S(k), which
is the basis of our investigation, is also a Fourier-type transform of the primes
(without any weights) but in a more direct sense:

where p runs over the primes in the interval [M, M + L], the number of which we
denote by N . A weighted version of the inner sum, which weights each prime p
and also its higher powers pl by ln p, has been much studied in connection with the
circle method (see section 25 of [8], for example). The behavior of S(k) for small
values of k reﬂects the large-scale correlations between primes.

Figure 1.2. The structure factor S(k) of the prime numbers for
M = 1010 + 1 and L = 105 obtained in a separate numerical
study [56]. It is seen that it contains many well-deﬁned Dirac-delta-
function like (Bragg-like) peaks of various intensities characterized
by a type of self-similarity. Included in the ﬁgure is the correspond-
ing structure factor for the uncorrelated lattice (Poisson) gas on
the integer lattice, whose intensities are barely perceptible on the
scale of this ﬁgure.

In a very recent numerical study [56], we and Martelli examined the pair statistics
of the primes, especially the structure factor S(k), in an interval M ≤ p ≤ M + L
with M and L large such that L/M is a positive constant smaller than unity. The
simulations strongly suggest that the structure factor exhibits many well-deﬁned
Dirac-delta-function (Bragg-like) peaks along with a small “diﬀuse” contribution;
see Fig. 1.2. This means that the primes are characterized by a substantial amount
of order on many length scales, especially relative to the uncorrelated lattice gas
(i.e., Poisson distribution of points on the integer lattice) that does not have any
such peaks; see Sec. 2 for a precise deﬁnition. Motivated by this numerical study, we
employ analytic number theory to understand rigorously the nature of the primes
as a point process by quantifying the pair correlation function, structure factor,
local number variance and a certain scalar order metric. While some of the major
results were announced in a letter [49], few mathematical details and derivations
were presented there. Here such details are provided and we also report results that
are not contained in Ref. [49].
In Sec. 2, we provide relevant deﬁnitions. In Sec. 3, we analyze the period-
doubling chain, a simple example of a point process with dense Bragg peaks (Dirac
delta function) that illustrates the phenomenon of limit-periodicity, which we will
see applies in a modiﬁed form to the primes. In Sec. 4, we show that the structure
factor deﬁned in (1.8) is characterized by sharp peaks at certain rational multiples π,

6 SALVATORE TORQUATO, GE ZHANG, AND MATTHEW DE COURCY-IRELAND

which become progressively denser as M increases, and negligibly small elsewhere.
The major result is stated in Proposition 1 and a corresponding corollary. Assuming
the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture, this gives what we call an eﬀective limit-periodic
form for the structure factor. In Sec. 5, we show that, in the inﬁnite-size limit, the
primes in a dyadic interval form a hyperuniform point process of class II (see Propo-
sition 2). This involves the aforementioned structure factor as well as a cumulative
version of it, deﬁned by (2.15), and the number variance σ2(R) associated with
a “window” of length 2R. In Sec. 6, we employ a scalar order metric τ , derived
from the structure factor, to determine how τ scales with the system size L (see
Proposition 3) and to identify a transition between large values of τ , when L is
comparable to M , and small τ in Gallagher’s uncorrelated regime, where L is only
logarithmic in M . In Sec. 7, we summarize the classiﬁcation of the primes as a
certain limit-periodic, hyperuniform point process. In Sec. 8, we describe further
numerical investigations into the size of the structure factor S(k). In Sec. 9, we
discuss the possibility of reconstructing the primes from the limit-periodic form of
the inner sum in Eq. (1.8).
 2. Definitions

A stochastic point process in a set X is a collection of points with conﬁgurational
positions x1, x2, x3 . . . whose distribution is described by a probability measure on
the set of all possible collections. Each conﬁguration in X satisﬁes two regularity
conditions: (i) there are no multiple points (xi ̸= xj if i ̸= j) and (ii) each bounded
subset of X must contain only a ﬁnite number of points. Here we restrict ourselves
to one-dimensional point processes. The set X can be one-dimensional Euclidean
space R (continuum systems), discrete systems (e.g., the integer lattice Z), the
one-dimensional torus T, or discrete systems on T. The latter two cases constitute
periodic point processes. A particular conﬁguration (realization) of a point process
in X can formally be characterized by the random variable

(2.1) η(r) = ∑

i=1 δ(r − xi)

called the “local” density at position r, where δ(r) is a d-dimensional Dirac delta
function. Two particularly important averages are the one-particle and two-particle
correlation functions, ρ1(r1) and ρ2(r1, r2), respectively. When X is Rd (continuous
systems), they are deﬁned as follows:

(2.2) ρ1(r1) = ⟨η(r1)⟩,

(2.3) ρ2(r1, r2) = ⟨η(r1)η(r2)⟩ − ρ1(r1)δ(r1 − r2),

where the angular brackets denote an average with respect to the probability mea-
sure. The random setting when X is R is perfectly general and includes lattices and
periodic point processes as special cases. A lattice in R is a subgroup consisting
of the integer linear combinations of vectors that constitute a basis for R. In a
lattice in R, the space can be geometrically divided into identical regions called
fundamental cells, each of which contains just one point. In one dimension, there
is only one lattice, namely, the integer lattice Z. The dual of the integer lattice
with fundamental-cell spacing a is an integer lattice with spacing 2π/a, which we
denote by Z
∗. A one-dimensional periodic point process (crystal) in R (points in

HIDDEN MULTISCALE ORDER IN THE PRIMES 7

T) is obtained by placing a ﬁxed conﬁguration of N points (where N ≥ 1) within
a fundamental cell F of the integer lattice, which is then periodically replicated.
In the special case of statistically homogeneous point processes in R, all of the
correlation functions are translationally invariant, the ﬁrst two of which are then
simply given by

(2.4) ρ1(r1) = ρ,

(2.5) ρ2(r1, r2) = ρ2g2(r2 − r1).

Here the constant ρ is the number density (number of points per unit volume) and
g2(r) is the pair correlation function. It is useful to introduce the total correlation
function h(r), which is related to the pair correlation function via

h(r) ≡ g2(r) − 1(2.6)

and decays to zero for large |r| in the absence of long-range order. Note that
h(r) = 0 for all r for the translationally invariant Poisson point process.
The structure factor S(k) is deﬁned as follows:

(2.7) S(k) = 1 + ρ˜h(k),

where

(2.8) ˜h(k) = ∫

Rd h(r) exp [−i(k · r)] dr

is the Fourier transform of h(r) so that

(2.9) h(r) = 1
(2π)d
 ∫

Rd ˜h(k) exp [i(k · r)] dk.

While S(k) is a nontrivial function for spatially correlated point processes, it is
identically equal to 1 for all k for a translationally invariant Poisson point process.
In general, the structure factor of a statistically homogeneous point process can
be uniquely be decomposed into three contributions [2]:

(2.10) S(k) = S(k)pp + S(k)sc + S(k)ac,

where S(k)pp is the “pure point” (Dirac-delta masses) part, S(k)sc is the singular-
continuous part, and S(k)ac is the absolutely-continuous part. In the case of the
integer lattice, S(k) only consists of the pure-point part. The same is true for a one-
dimensional quasicrystal, such as the Fibonacci chain that is characterized by the
golden ratio, except here the Dirac-delta functions are dense [26]. The Fibonacci
chain is a special case of one-dimensional patterns constructed from substitution
rules involving algebraic numbers, and limit-periodic chains are closely related pat-
terns but are characterized by rational numbers [2]. One-dimensional point sets
generated from substitution rules involving non-Pisot numbers will consist only of
singular-continuous contributions [5]. In the case of a Poisson point process, the
only contribution to the structure factor is the absolutely continuous part. In stark
contrast, we will show that the primes in certain intervals are dominated by a set
of dense Bragg peaks.
A hyperuniform statistically homogeneous point process in d-dimensional Eu-
clidean space Rd is one in which the structure factor S(k) tends to zero as the
wavenumber k ≡ |k| tends to zero, i.e.,

(2.11) lim
|k|→0 S(k) = 0,

8 SALVATORE TORQUATO, GE ZHANG, AND MATTHEW DE COURCY-IRELAND

implying that single scattering of incident radiation at inﬁnite wavelengths is com-
pletely suppressed. This class of point conﬁgurations includes perfect crystals, a
large class of perfect quasicrystals [55, 37] and special disordered many-particle sys-
tems. Observe that the structure-factor deﬁnition (2.7) and the hyperuniformity
requirement (2.11) dictate that the volume integral of ρh(r) over all space is exactly
equal to −1, i.e.,

(2.12) ρ ∫

Rd h(r)dr = −1,

which is a direct-space sum rule that a hyperuniform point process must obey. The
hyperuniformity property can be stated in terms of the the local number variance
σ2(R) associated within an interval (window) of length 2R for a one-dimensional
homogeneous point process [48]:

σ2(R) = ρ2R[
1 + ρ ∫

R h(r)α2(r; R)dr
]

= ρR
π
 ∫

R S(k)˜α2(k; R)dk,(2.13)

where α(r; R) = 1 − r/(2R) for r ≤ 2R and zero otherwise, and ˜α(k; R) =
2 sin
2(kR)/(kR). A hyperuniform point process is one in which σ2(R) grows more
slowly than R in the large-R limit. Three classes of hyperuniformity are to be dis-
tinguished: class I, where σ2(R) is bounded; class II, where σ2(R) is logarithmic in
R; and class III, where σ2(R) scales as a power R1−α with 0 < α < 1 (or d − α for
a d-dimensional system) [46]. After integrating by parts, the second line of (2.13)
leads to an alternative representation of the number variance [37]:

(2.14) σ2(R) = − ρR
(π)
 ∫ ∞

0 Z(k) ∂ ˜α2(k; R)
∂k dk,

where

(2.15) Z(K) = 2 ∫ K

0 S(k)dk

is the integrated or cumulative intensity function within a “sphere” of radius K of
the origin in reciprocal space. The quantity Z(k) has advantages over S(k) in the
characterization of quasicrystals and other point processes with dense Bragg peaks
[37]. If S(k) tends to 0 as a power kα, then its integral Z(K) will tend to 0 as a
power one higher, Z(K) ∼ K α+1. Any positive power α > 0 yields hyperuniformity
and distinguishes the system from a random conﬁguration of Poisson points with
the same density.
When X is discrete, such as the integer lattice, it sometimes convenient to use
the same notation as Eqs. (2.1)-(2.5) such that δ(r − xi) is interpreted to be the
Kronecker delta δr,xi, which means that η(r) takes either the value 0 or 1, depending
on whether the site r ∈ X is unoccupied (empty) or occupied. In the special case
of statistically homogeneous point processes, while the deﬁnition (2.6) remains the
same, relations (2.4) and (2.5) are modiﬁed as follows:

(2.16) ρ1(r1) = f,

(2.17) ρ2(r1, r2) = f 2g2(r2 − r1),

HIDDEN MULTISCALE ORDER IN THE PRIMES 9

where f is the occupation fraction (fraction of occupied sites). Similarly, equation
(2.7) for the structure factor becomes in the discrete setting

(2.18) S(k) = 1 − f + f ˜h(k),

where ˜h(k) is the discrete Fourier transform

(2.19) ˜h(k) = ∑

r̸=0,r∈X h(r) exp [−i(k · r)] ,

where h(r) = g2(r) − 1. Note that 1 − f is the structure factor of the uncorrelated
lattice gas, which is a stochastic point process in X in which the occupation of
each site is a constant probability f , independent of any other other site. While
the Fourier-space hyperuniformity condition for discrete X is still given by relation
(2.11), the corresponding direct-space condition

(2.20) ∑

r̸=0,r∈X h(r) = f − 1
f .

The relation between the local number variance σ2(R) and the structure factor
S(k) is unchanged from Eq. (2.13). It is noteworthy that the sum rule (2.20) is
a condition for hyperuniformity in the grand-canonical (open-system) ensemble in
which the number of particles ﬂuctuates around some average value; see Refs. [48]
and [46] for details in the continuous-space setting. For a system in which the
number of particles is ﬁxed, the sum rule still applies but it is satisﬁed whether the
system is hyperuniform or not.
For a single periodic point conﬁguration of N points within F , speciﬁed by its
local density η(r) [cf. (2.1)], it is useful to introduce the complex collective density
variable ˜η(k), which is simply the Fourier transform of η(r), i.e.,

(2.21) ˜η(k) =
 N∑

j=1 exp(−ik · rj).

This quantity is directly linked to the scattering intensity S(k) deﬁned as

(2.22) S(k) = |˜η(k)|2

N ,

which is a nonnegative real function with inversion-symmetry, i.e.,

(2.23) S(k) = S(−k)

that obeys the bounds

(2.24) 0 ≤ S(k) ≤ N (k ̸= 0)

with S(0) = N . For a single periodic conﬁguration with a ﬁnite number of N
points within a fundamental cell F , the scattering intensity S(k) is identical to the
structure factor S(k) [cf. (2.7)], except the latter excludes k = 0 (forward scatter-
ing). In general, whether they remain equal in the inﬁnite-system limit depends
on the ergodicity of the process, but this issue does not aﬀect our analysis of the
primes, and so we will simply take Eq.(1.8) to be the deﬁnition of the structure fac-
tor. Importantly, the deﬁnition of hyperuniformity excludes the forward scattering
contribution, which is implicit in (2.11).

A useful scalar positive order metric that is capable of capturing the degree of
translational order across length scales is the τ order metric [50]. For a statistically
homogeneous point process in Rd at number density ρ, it is deﬁned by

τ ≡ 1
Dd
 ∫

Rd [g2(r) − 1]2dr(2.25)
 = 1
(2π)dDd
 ∫

Rd [S(k) − 1]2dk,(2.26)

where D is some characteristic length scale. A convenient choice is D = ρ−1/d.
For a Poisson point process in Rd, τ = 0 because g2(r) − 1 is zero for all r. Thus,
a deviation of τ from zero measures translational order with respect to the fully
uncorrelated case. For example, for the Riemann zeta zeros, τ = 2/3, assuming
Montgomery’s pair correlation conjecture or, equivalently, the corresponding struc-
ture factor (1.6), which reﬂects the disordered hyperuniformity of the point process.
For any periodic point process in which there are a ﬁnite number of points within
the fundamental cell F , τ is unbounded because the integrals are carried out over
all space. For this reason, one can employ a modiﬁed version of τ by carrying out
the integral in direct space or reciprocal space over appropriate subsets of Rd, in
which case the equality in Eq. (2.26) no longer applies.
The discrete-setting counterpart of the order metric τ deﬁned in (2.26) in which
X is a subset of Z on the torus T in which the fundamental cell has length L is
given by
 τ ≡
 N s−1∑

j=1 f 2[g2(2j) − 1]2(2.27)
 = 1
Ns
 N s−1∑

j=1
 (
S ( jπ
Ns
 ) − (1 − f )
)2 ,(2.28)

where Ns is the number of lattice sites within the fundamental cell and N is the
number of occupied sites. Strictly speaking, the quantities g2(r) and S(k) are
ensemble averages. In the case of an uncorrelated lattice gas, S = 1 − f in the
inﬁnite-system-size limit so that τ = 0. The corresponding expression in the discrete
setting for a single conﬁguration in any space dimension was presented and applied
in Ref. [9]. Here g2(r) and S(k) should be interpreted to come from a single
conﬁguration. Analysis of the primes in some ﬁxed interval requires the use of this
single-conﬁguration variant of τ , which we will employ. Note that τ for a single
conﬁguration of an uncorrelated lattice gas is given by (1 − f )
2 (not zero) in the
inﬁnite-system-size limit.

3. An Illustrative Example: The Period-Doubling Chain

The spatial distribution of the primes shares some features with limit-periodic
point sets, so we discuss a model example in detail. Consider two types of intervals
(“tiles” or “letters”): a and b. The period-doubling chain is deﬁned by the following
iterative substitution rule: a → ab and b → aa [2]. In the inﬁnite-size limit, this
constitutes a point process on Z in which a subset of sites are occupied by a’s and
the remaining sites are occupied by b’s. The locations of the b’s are given by a
superposition of arithmetic progressions 2 + 4j, 8 + 16j, 32 + 64j, with a factor of
4 from one to the next. Thus the inﬁnite-size limit is a union of periodic systems,

which is termed limit-periodic. The limiting densities of a and b sites are 2/3 and
1/3, respectively. The structure factor associated with the a’s is given by

assuming unit lattice spacing. This is obtained by squaring Eq. (12) in Ref. [2],
multiplying it by 2π/f , and then rescaling the function by 2π. The factor 2π
accounts for diﬀerences in the deﬁnition of the Fourier transform. Thus, we have a
dense set of Dirac-delta-function peaks, one for each dyadic rational (2m − 1)/2n−1;
see Fig. 3.1. These peaks at certain rational numbers arbitrarily close to 0 are
a feature shared by this example and the prime numbers. Figure 3.1 depicts the
structure factor of the period-doubling chain.

Substitution of this expression (3.1) for the structure factor into relation (2.13)
yields the local number variance for the period-doubling chain:

The ﬁrst term in (3.2) is a periodic function R(1 − 2R)/9 with period 1/2 and the
second term is a superposition of periodized “triangle” functions with heights 1/9
and bases 1, 2, 4, · · · .. Together this results in a number variance that grows loga-
rithmically in R; see Fig. 3.2. Therefore, the period-doubling chain is hyperuniform
of class II.
Having established that the period-doubling chain is hyperuniform, we now want
to determine how the structure factor S(k) behaves in the vicinity of the origin. The
structure factor S(k) is not a continuous function because there are dense Bragg
peaks arbitrarily close to 0, so we do not have S(k) → 0 as k → 0 in the usual
sense. We follow the practice of Ref. [37] in such instances and pass to a cumulative
version of the structure factor, Z(K), deﬁned by (2.15). This integral simply adds

Figure 3.3 shows the function Z(k) and the aforementioned upper and lower bounds.
Thus Z(K) is bounded between two multiples of K 2, with a self-similar staircase-
like behaviour in between. Using these bounds and relation (2.14), we get the

This implies that the period-doubling chain falls within class II of hyperuniform
systems with a structure factor that eﬀectively behaves as S(k) ∼ k as k → 0
[46]. These asymptotic bounds closely match the upper and lower envelopes of the
ﬂuctuating number variance function plotted in Fig. 3.2.

4. Primes in Progressions and Peaks in the Structure Factor

Here we provide the theoretical basis for the numerical results reported in Ref.
[56] that shows that the dominant contribution to the structure factor S(k) in an
interval [M, M + L] (with M and L large, and L/M smaller than unity) consists
of many well-deﬁned Dirac-delta-function peaks. We show that in the inﬁnite-
system-size limit (M → ∞, L/M → β > 0) and after scaling by the density ρ, the
peaks in the structure factor of the primes will become Dirac delta functions at
rational numbers with odd, square-free denominators, and hence the small diﬀuse
part observed numerically in Ref. [56], vanishes in this limit. This major result is
summarized in the following proposition:

Proposition 1: The structure factor of the prime numbers, scaled by the the density
ρ, in an interval M ≤ p ≤ M + L in the limit such that M → ∞, L/M → β > 0 is
given by

(4.1) lim

Here, φ(n) is Euler’s totient, which counts the numbers up to n with no factor in
common with n [45], the symbol ♭ indicates that the sum over n only involves odd,

14 SALVATORE TORQUATO, GE ZHANG, AND MATTHEW DE COURCY-IRELAND

square-free values of n and the symbol × indicates that m and n have no common
factor.

Remark 1: Since L/M = β is ﬁxed, and in particular M + L is within a constant
multiple of M , the prime number theorem implies that the density ρ is eﬀectively
1/ ln(M ) throughout the interval. We see that this normalized structure factor of
the primes (4.1) exhibits dense Bragg peaks at certain rational values of k/π, and
hence is similar to the structure factor (3.1) of the limit-periodic period-doubling
chain discussed in Sec. 3. However, there is a fundamental diﬀerence between these
two systems, to be elaborated on in Sec. 7.

Remark 2: The interpretation of (4.1) is that S(k)/(2πρ) converges to the sum
of peaks ∑
n ∑m φ(n)
−2δ(k − πm/n) in the sense that their integrals against test
functions f (k) are close:

In particular, consider f (k) = e−irk. For r ̸= 0, this gives a count of how often p
and p + r are both prime.

In what follows, we give a derivation of (4.1). Our approach is somewhat diﬀerent
than the original approach of Hardy and Littlewood, which is outlined in Appendix
A.

4.1. Derivation of Proposition 1. Our ﬁrst step is to replace S(k) by another
sum involving the more convenient weights Λ(n) given by ln(p) when n is a power of
the prime p, and 0 otherwise. One uses summation by parts to convert the weights,
and then includes higher powers at essentially no cost. Indeed, if pt < Y with t ≥ 2,
then p < Y 1/2. A sum over so few terms introduces an error of order no worse than
L1/2. The result for the complex density variable ˜η(k) (cf. 2.21) is

(4.3) ˜η(k) = ∑

M<p≤M+L eikp = 1

 M+L∑

n=M+1 Λ(n)eiαn + O ( L

 ) .

Let us take the absolute square and, to bound the error, resort to the trivial bound∑ Λ(n)eiαn ≲ L. We divide by ρN and note that ρ ∼ 1/ ln(M ) and N ∼ ρL, to
arrive at

We split the integral into arcs M(q, a) = {|α − a/q| < ε} near fractions a/q with
small denominator q (major arcs), and write m for the rest of the interval (minor
arcs). The denominator is restricted to q ≤ qmax and we choose qmax = ln(L)
B,
with a constant B as large as one pleases. The length ε of each major arc is chosen
to be ε = ln(L)
B/L, and in principle diﬀerent lengths could be adapted to the test
function f . Let us ﬁrst calculate the contribution from the arcs M(q, a), returning
later to the discussion of the minor arcs.

the approximation

This plays the role of Hardy-Littlewood’s approximation to f (x) in Lemma 9 of
[20]. It follows from p. 147 in [8] or, what is the same, Lemma 3.1 in [51] (p.30).
They take M = 1 but one can of course subtract. We summarize the argument
from [8] for the reader’s beneﬁt in order to emphasize the role played by primes in
arithmetic progression.
The basic idea is to decompose with respect to Dirichlet characters modulo
q. These are functions χ(n) deﬁned for integer values of n and characterized by
the properties of periodicity and multiplicativity, namely χ(n + q) = χ(n) and
χ(ab) = χ(a)χ(b). They are the natural harmonics to use in a situation with
period q that preserves multiplicative structure, such as remainders after division
by q. One character χ0 is distinguished, given by χ0(n) = 1 for gcd(n, q) = 1 and
χ0(n) = 0 in case gcd(n, q) > 1. As a rule of thumb, χ0 provides the main term
and we must endeavor to show that the contributions from other characters χ are
negligible. The phase e(an/q) can be expanded as a sum over Dirichlet characters
χ modulo q. Assuming gcd(an, q) = 1, we have

(4.5) e(an/q) = 1
φ(q)
 ∑

χ G(χ)χ(ap).

The sum is over all Dirichlet characters modulo q. If gcd(an, q) > 1, then the sum
is 0. We recommend [8] for the theory of Dirichlet characters as well as the Gauss
sum G(χ). By deﬁnition,

(4.6) G(χ) =
 q∑

m=1 χ(m)e2πim/q,

and it is important to note that |G(χ)| ≤ q1/2 while G(χ0) = µ(q) is the M¨obius
function. Since n is a prime power and a has no factor in common with q, gcd(an, q) =
1 does hold unless n is a power of a prime dividing q. Factoring q as q = p1p2 · · · pw ≥
2w shows that there are at most ln(q) primes dividing q. For each such p, a prime
power n = pl will be less than M + L for l ≲ ln(M ). In our range, with a value
of qmax much less than M , we thus have gcd(an, q) = 1 except for at most ln(M )
2

terms n. With an error no worse than a power of ln(M ), we may thus ignore these
exceptions, proceeding as if (4.5) held for all n. Write α = k/π = a/q + t and
e(z) = e2πiz for convenience. Summing over n gives

where, for an upper limit u and a character χ to modulus q,

(4.9) ψ(u, χ) = ∑

n<u Λ(n)χ(n).

By the prime number theorem in progressions (p. 125, 132 of [8]), there is a
positive c > 0 such that for all characters to moduli q ≤ ln(L)
B, ψ(u, χ0) =
u + O( exp(−c√
ln(u)
) while for nontrivial χ, ψ(u, χ) = O( exp(−c√
ln(u))
)
. This
leads to the error term stated in (4.4) (and the Riemann hypothesis would imply
an estimate for an even larger range of q).
Summing the geometric series, we have

Note that ec√
ln(L) is much larger than ln(L)
b = eb ln ln L for any positive values of a
and b. Thus the errors from using the prime number theorem are smaller than the
error L/ ln(M )
2 that we have already exposed ourselves to through summation by
parts. Therefore, the structure factor in the vicinity of a particular peak location
k for some a and q and suﬃciently small t is given by

.

In the limit that t tends to zero faster than L goes to inﬁnity, and M → ∞ such
that L/M remains ﬁnite, this formula with q = 2n and a = m yields the limiting
form (4.1) of Proposition 1 with dense Bragg peaks.

Corollary: For ﬁnite but large N , the structure factor at a rational value of k/π is
given by

(4.12) S(πm/n) ∼ N
φ(2n)2 µ(2n)
2.

This formula follows immediately from (4.11). The M¨obius function µ(n) [45] ap-
pears here because µ2(2n) is one whenever 2n is square-free and zero otherwise.
Also, φ(n) = φ(2n) if n is odd. We will show below that this formula is in excellent
agreement with the numerical results reported in Ref. [56].
Now we provide strong arguments to demonstrate that the structure factor is
negligibly small at the irrationals in the inﬁnite-system-size limit. We recall Fej´er’s
theorem that for a continous, periodic function f , we have uniform convergence

Suppose that f has modulus of continuity ω, meaning that |f (x) − f (y)| ≤ ω(ε)
whenever |x − y| ≤ ε. For example, if f has continuous derivatives of order up to
m, then ω(ε) = ∥f ∥C mεm is a valid modulus of continuity for f . Using once more
the fact that the integral of the Fej´er kernel is 1, we have

Dividing the interval [0, 1] into the major arcs M(a, q) for q ≤ qmax together with
the remaining minor arcs m, and summing the error made in Fej´er’s theorem over
q ≤ qmax, we get

Note that µ(q)
2 is simply 1 or 0 according to whether q is squarefree, so the sum is
restricted to squarefree q. This agrees with the sum of δ functions in our limiting
form (4.1). We assume that f is smooth enough to have ωf (ε) ln(qmax) → 0, where
ǫ = ln(L)
B/L = qmax/L. For example, this is the case if f is C1 or even just H¨older
continuous with any exponent α, since εα ln(qmax) → 0. In particular, one may
take f (k) = eikr for the application to prime pairs. Likewise, ln(qmax)/Lε → 0.

Let us reiterate that proving that the minor arcs contribute less than the major arcs
is a signiﬁcant challenge, which we have not solved. Nevertheless, the analysis is
very suggestive, and the limiting form (4.1) is also supported by numerical results,
as we now illustrate.
Figure 4.1 compares the prediction of formula (4.12) for the structure factor
of the primes for M = 1010 + 1, L = 2.23 × 108 and nmax = 100 ln(M ) to the
corresponding numerical results reported in Ref. [56]. Agreement between the
analytical and numerical results is excellent. The structure factor contains many
well-deﬁned Bragg-like peaks of various intensities characterized by a type of self-
similarity. This is explained by the fact that φ(n1n2) = φ(n1)φ(n2) for relatively
prime n1 and n2, so that rescaling preserves the relative heights of the peaks given
by Eq. (4.1).

and nmax = 100 ln(M ). This shows many peaks with a type of
self-similarity described in the main body of the text and is seen
to be in excellent agreement with the corresponding numerically
computed structure factor obtained in Ref. [56].

4.2. Pair Correlation Function. We now obtain the pair correlation function
g2(r) of the primes via the limiting form of the structure factor (4.1) by performing
the inverse Fourier transform of S(k) − 1 ≡ ρ˜h(k) using (2.9), where ˜h(k) is the
Fourier transform of h(r) ≡ g2(r) − 1 for r ̸= 0:

Recall that the pair correlation function is deﬁned such that f g2(r) gives the con-
ditional probability that, assuming p is prime, so is p + r. Because the density of
the primes is 1/ ln(M ), the occupation fraction is f = 2/ ln(M ), and the density of
prime pairs with separation r [cf. (2.5)] is

From (1.2) and (4.16), we see that expression (4.15) for g2(r) for distinct values of
r = 2, 4, 6, . . . is simply a diﬀerent representation of the Hardy-Littlewood constant
S(H), given by (1.3), for the case m = 2 so that H = {0, r}. Thus, (4.1) implies

HIDDEN MULTISCALE ORDER IN THE PRIMES 19

the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture on prime pairs by taking the test function f (k)
of (4.2) to be eikr. Conversely, if the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture holds for every
r, then one knows (4.1) for exponential functions eirk and one can deduce it for
other functions f (k) by Fourier expansion. The limiting form for S(k) is thus an
equivalent formulation of the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture. As such, we certainly
do not have a proof of it to oﬀer here.

5. Hyperuniformity

Proposition 2: The primes in the inﬁnite-system-size limit such that M → ∞,
L/M → β > 0 form a hyperuniform point process of class II.

Proof: As in the period-doubling chain, to determine whether the primes are hyper-
uniform, we ﬁrst determine the cumulative intensity Z(K) deﬁned by (2.15). Using
this relation and (4.1), we ﬁnd that this quantity

Given a cutoﬀ so that only values cN count as peaks in the ﬁnite-system structure
factor, the denominator n does not exceed √
1/c. On the other hand, n must be
large enough for there to be a peak mπ/n less than K:

(5.2) π
K ≤ n ≤
 √ 1
c = nmax.

In particular, the lowest allowable K is π/nmax.
For the sum over m, note that
∑

m<cn

×1 = cφ(n) + Oǫ(nǫ),

Thus the number of m coprime to n is growing regularly: Summing only up to
cn yields a fraction c of the total φ(n). To see this, we use the M¨obius inversion
property, namely

(5.3) ∑

d|t µ(d) =
 {1 if t = 1
0 if t > 1

to detect the condition gcd(m, n) = 1. This implies that for any c (it will be K/π
for us, no longer the same as the peak cutoﬀ c above)
∑

m<cn

×1 = ∑

m<cn
 ∑

Now we write ⌊cn/d⌋ = cn/d − {cn/d} in terms of integer part and fractional part:
∑

d|n µ(d)⌊cn/d⌋ = c ∑

d|n µ(d) n
d − ∑

d|n µ(d){cn/d}.

The main term cφ(n) thus comes from the identity

Recall that there is a lower bound on K: K ≥ π/nmax. Expanding the function
Z(K) in (5.6) around this value, taking nmax to be of order ln M , and then taking
the limit M → ∞ does lead to hyperuniformity such that Z(K) ∼ K 2 as K → 0.

Remark: The result Z(K) ∼ K 2 as K → 0 implies that the primes fall within class
II of hyperuniform systems with a structure factor S(k) that eﬀectively is linear in
k as k → 0 [46], so that the number variance σ2(R) scales logarithmically with R
in the large-R limit. Figure 5.1 depicts Z(K) for the primes as determined from

6. τ Order Metric

We now study the order metric τ in the discrete setting [c.f. (2.28)] as a function
of the system size L for the primes and the integer lattice.

Proposition 3: The order metric τ of the primes as a function of the system size
L in the considered interval [M, M + L] (when divided by ρ2) obeys the following
scaling relation:

(6.1) τ /ρ2 ∼ cL,

where c is some constant.

HIDDEN MULTISCALE ORDER IN THE PRIMES 21

This dependence of τ on L can be understood in terms of the peaks in the
structure factor via the deﬁnition (2.28). We have

(6.2) τ = 1
Ns

j=1 (S(jπ/Ns) − 1 + f )
2 .

We have seen how to estimate S(πm/n) at a rational number in lowest terms: If
the denominator is square-free, there will be a peak of height N/φ(n)
2 while, if not,
the structure factor will be very small. There could be a common factor between j
and Ns, so let

(6.3) n = Ns
gcd(j, Ns) .

This makes j/Ns = m/n in lowest terms with numerator m = j/ gcd(j, Ns). As-
sume for simplicity that Ns is square-free so that all of the resulting denominators
n will be square-free. Then we have

τ ∼ 1

The fact that the last sum is convergent proves the proposition. Alternatively, one
could use the expression (2.28) for τ and substitute the value predicted by Hardy-
Littlewood for g2(2j).
In the case of the integer lattice, τ can be calculated directly from its deﬁnition
(2.28). Since of the Ns − 1 terms in the sum in (2.28), 1/f − 1 terms involve S(k)
at Bragg peak locations, while the remaining terms involved S(k) values away from
Bragg peaks, we have

(6.4) τ = 1
Ns
 [( 1
f − 1) (N − 1 + f )
2 + (
Ns − 1

 ) (0 − 1 + f )

For suﬃciently large systems, the contribution from the second term is negligible,
and N is much larger than 1 − f , yielding

(6.5) τ ≈ 1
Ns
 ( 1

Plugging in Ns = L/2, f = 2ρ, and N = ρL, one gets

τ ≈ 2
L
 ( 1
2ρ − 1) (ρL)

= Lρ(1 − 2ρ),

which is consistent with Eq. (6.1) for the primes when the density is ﬁxed.
We have numerically computed τ for the primes and integer lattice by generating
such conﬁgurations, sampling for their structure factors, and then computing their
corresponding values of τ using relation (2.28). For the primes, we take M ≈
108, and therefore f = 2ρ ≈ 2/ ln(M ) ≈ 0.11. For the integer lattice, we take

22 SALVATORE TORQUATO, GE ZHANG, AND MATTHEW DE COURCY-IRELAND

f = 0.1. The constant c is 18.00 for the integer lattice and 0.1674 for the primes.
These results are plotted in Fig. 6.1. Notice that for a single conﬁguration of
an uncorrelated lattice-gas, τ does not grow with L and converges in probability
to a constant of order unity [see discussion under Eq. (2.28)]. This means that
the primes in these prescribed intervals are substantially more ordered than the
uncorrelated lattice gas and appreciably less ordered than an integer lattice.

discrete setting as a function of the system size L for the primes
and integer lattice with ﬁlling fraction f = 0.1 obtained by direct
simulations from Eqs. (2.28) and (6.1).

Now we study the τ order metric of prime-number conﬁgurations with diﬀerent
M and L, obtained by computing their structure factors and evaluating (2.28). As
Fig. 6.2 shows, the constant-τ level curves have the form L ∼ ln
2(M ), i.e., level
curves appear as quadratic curves in the log plot depicted in Fig. 6.2. This follows
from the fact that τ is proportional to ρ2L, the density ρ being given by the prime
number theorem as 1/ ln(M ). Thus, L ∼ ln2(M ) is the boundary between regions
where primes can be considered to be uncorrelated versus those where they exhibit
correlations.
The regime L ∼ ln(M )
2 marks another important dividing line. Consider the
Cram´er model where one replaces the number of primes from M to M + L by a
sum of random variables taking the values 0 and 1 with probabilities chosen to
match the prime number theorem. A sum of L such random variables will have
ﬂuctuations on the order of L1/2, by the Central Limit Theorem or by an elementary
calculation, while the main term is L/ ln(M ). Thus, at least for the random model,
L ∼ ln(M )
2 is a turning point between short intervals, where L/ ln(M )
2 → 0 and
the ﬂuctuations overwhelm the prime number theorem, and longer intervals, where
L ln(M )
2 → ∞ and the ﬂuctuations can be neglected. Selberg [43], assuming the
Riemann hypothesis, proved that for L/ ln(M )
2 → ∞, the number of primes from
M to M +L is L/ ln(M ) as predicted by the prime number theorem, except possibly
for a sparse sequence of exceptional values of M . One might guess that this holds
without exception, but Maier proved that there are inﬁnitely many such M [28].

HIDDEN MULTISCALE ORDER IN THE PRIMES 23

For any power c > 1, and setting L = ln(M )
c, Maier proves

(6.6) lim sup
M→∞
 N
L/ ln(M ) > 1 > lim inf
M→∞ N
ln(M ) .

The behaviour of primes in intervals of this length is thus a signiﬁcant departure
from the random model. For the uncorrelated regime in which Gallagher’s results
apply, L ∼ ln(M ), and τ will diminish as M increases. As L increases, prime-
number conﬁgurations move from the uncorrelated regime (τ ∼ 1, L ≤ ln
2(M )) to
the eﬀective limit-periodic regime we studied in this paper (τ ∼ L, L ∝ M ), and
then to the inhomogeneous regime where the density gradient is no longer negligible
(e.g., if L ∼ M 1+ǫ and ǫ > 0.) In this last phase, the number variance σ2(R) grows
faster than the window volume (i.e., faster than R), which is the diametric opposite
of hyperuniformity.

7. Classification of the Primes

Using Eq. (4.1), we have shown that the primes are like a limit-periodic point
process, i.e., they are characterized by a structure factor S(k) with dense Bragg
peaks at certain rational values of k/π derived from an inﬁnite union of periodic
systems in the limit as M → ∞ with L ∼ βM . This is similar to the structure

24 SALVATORE TORQUATO, GE ZHANG, AND MATTHEW DE COURCY-IRELAND

factor of the limit-periodic systems; see Sec. 3. However, the primes show an erratic
pattern of occupied and unoccupied sites, very diﬀerent from the predictable and
orderly patterns of standard limit–periodic systems. Hence, the primes represent
the ﬁrst example of a point process that is eﬀectively limit-periodic.
We have also demonstrated that the primes are hyperuniform of class II. Inter-
estingly, this is precisely the same hyperuniformity class to which the (normalized)
zeros of the Riemann zeta function belong. However, the primes are substantially
more ordered, having dense Bragg peaks instead of a continuous structure factor.
As a result, one can only claim that S(k) → 0 in a cumulative sense, unlike the
case of the zeros. While the Riemann zeros are disordered and hyperuniform, the
primes are eﬀectively limit-periodic and hence are characterized by order on all
length scales. In terms of τ , the primes are substantially more ordered than the
uncorrelated lattice gas and appreciably less ordered than an integer lattice, but
similar in order to the period-doubling chain. It should not go unnoticed that
the lack of multiscale order in the Riemann zeros is reﬂected in the fact that τ is
bounded in the large-L limit. Indeed, assuming Montgomery’s pair correlation con-
jecture, it converges to the constant 2/3 (which in the continuous setting should be
compared to τ = 0 for the Poisson point process; see discussion under Eq. (2.26)].
This value 2/3 is what one ﬁnds by substituting the conjectured form for the struc-
ture factor (see Fig. 1.1) in the deﬁnition (2.26) of τ in the continuous setting and
integrating (k/(2π) − 1)
2 over 0 < k < 2π. In a system with multiscale order, such
as the primes in dyadic intervals, τ diverges with L.
The condition that L ∼ M , under which we have shown heretofore unanticipated
order in the primes, is to be contrasted with the regime L ∼ ln(M ), in which the
primes follow Gallagher’s uncorrelated behavior. We have also shown that when L
grows faster than M , the primes enter the inhomogeneous regime where the density
gradient is no longer negligible and hence where the limit-periodicity breaks down.

8. Value Distribution of S(k)

In this section, we study how frequently the structure factor S(k) exceeds a given
threshold t. Here, we write S(k) for the structure factor of a ﬁnite system of N
primes M < p < M + L, namely

(8.1) S(k) = 1
N
 ∣
∣
∣

 .

Let

(8.2) λ(t) = 1
π |{0 ≤ k ≤ π ; S(k) > t}|

be the measure of the set where S(k) > t, relative to the total length of the interval
0 < k < π. We think of λ(t) as a cumulative distribution function (CDF). The
quantity λ(t) depends on M , not only t, but we suppress this dependence in the
notation. There is also a related quantity which measures how often S(k) > t while
excluding forward scattering:

(8.3) λ−(t) = ∣
∣
∣
∣

{ 2π
L < k < π − 2π
L ; S(k) > t}∣
∣
∣
∣ .

We have

(8.4) λ−(t) ≤ λ(t) ≤ λ−(t) + 2π/L,

HIDDEN MULTISCALE ORDER IN THE PRIMES 25

so the diﬀerence between λ(t) and λ−(t) is negligible in the limit of large L. By
orthogonality of the exponentials eikp, we have

(8.5) ∫ π

0 S(k)dk = π.

Since S(k) ≥ 0, it follows that

(8.6) π = ∫ π

0 S(k)dk ≥ ∫
{S(k)>t} S(k)dk ≥ tπλ(t).

Thus we have an upper bound

(8.7) λ(t) ≤ 1
t .

For t > 1, this is an improvement over the trivial bound λ(t) ≤ 1. For small t, Fig.
8.1 suggests that λ(t) is close to e−ct for some c > 0. If one imagines S(k) as a
small, noisy contribution on top of the peaks in its limiting form, this suggests that
the noise follows an exponential distribution. On the other hand, Fig. 8.2 suggests
that the upper bound (8.7) is the correct order of magnitude of λ(t) for large t. For
t on the order of N , the only way to have S(k) > t is for k to be close to a peak.
This leads to the “heavy-tailed” power-law behavior illustrated in Fig. 8.2.

bound (8.7).
 9. Reconstruction of the Primes

It is noteworthy that we not only have an analytical formula for the structure
factor S(k), which is related to the modulus of the complex density variable ˜η(k),
deﬁned by (2.21), but also for the phase of ˜η(k). The analytical expression for ˜η(k)
of the primes enables us to reconstruct, in principle, a prime-number conﬁguration
within an arbitrary interval [M, M + L] by obtaining the inverse Fourier transform
of ˜η(k). In this section, we will describe our procedure to reconstruct prime-number
conﬁgurations and report its accuracy.
We reconstruct a prime-number conﬁguration in an interval [M, M + L] by the
following steps:

(1) Calculate N = (M + L)/ ln(M + L) − M/ ln(M ). By the Prime Number
Theorem, N is the approximate number of primes in this interval.
(2) Initialize ˜η(k) at all k ̸= 0 to be zero. Set ˜η(0) = N .
(3) Find all odd square-free numbers n ≤ nmax.
(4) For each n, ﬁnd all integers m such that 0 < m < n and m is co-prime with
n.
(5) For each n and m, we need to reconstruct a peak at k = mπ/n. For the
purpose of reconstructing this peak, the prime-number conﬁguration can
be treated as a periodic system of period 2n. We then ﬁnd whether each
number in the ﬁrst period is prime, and calculate

(9.1) C1 = N
Ns
 n
φ(n)
 ∑

j
 × exp(ik2j),

HIDDEN MULTISCALE ORDER IN THE PRIMES 27

which is the contribution to ˜η from the ﬁrst n sites. The index j runs over
numbers up to N such that gcd(j, N ) = 1.
(6) If L is divisible by n, then the peak at k = mπ/n should have inﬁnitesimal
width. We therefore increase ˜η(mπ/n) by (L/n)C1, which is the predicted
value of ˜ρ(mπ/n).
(7) If L is not divisible by n, then the peak at k = mπ/n should have a ﬁnite
width. We therefore have to increase ˜η(k) of all k points adjacent to mπ/n
by

(9.2) ˜η(k) = C1
 ( 1 − f ⌊L/2n⌋

1 − f
 ) ,

where f = exp(−ik2n) is the phase change between the contribution to ˜η
from the ﬁrst n sites and that from the second n sites. Here, the criteria for
an “adjacent” k point is that the absolute value of the result from Eq. (9.2)
is larger than √
N .
(8) Perform an inverse Fourier transform of ˜η(k) to ﬁnd η(r).

If we had a completely accurate prediction of ˜η(k), the resulting local density η(r)
would be exactly one for each prime number and exactly zero for each composite
number. The predicted ˜η(k) is not completely accurate. A major reason for the
inaccuracy is that there should be inﬁnitely many peaks, but we only consider a
ﬁnite number of peaks for which n < nmax. Therefore, the resulting η(r) is not
exactly zero or one. We ﬁnd N numbers with the highest predicted η(r) and predict
those numbers to be prime. Thus another source of error is that we always predict
N primes, whereas the true number of primes may be more or less than the estimate
from the Prime Number Theorem.

We have performed such reconstructions for L = 510510 and several diﬀerent
M ’s and nmax’s. Let Nc be the number of correctly predicted primes, Ni be the
number of incorrect predictions, and Nu be the number of un-predicted primes in

28 SALVATORE TORQUATO, GE ZHANG, AND MATTHEW DE COURCY-IRELAND

this interval. We deﬁne the following ratios involving these quantities to measure
the accuracy of the reconstruction procedure:

(9.3) t1 = Nc
Ni ,

(9.4) t2 = Nc
Nu .

These two ratios versus nmax are plotted in Fig. 9.1. We see that for smaller
M ’s and larger nmax’s, this reconstruction procedure is highly accurate. When
M = 106 and nmax = 2000, more than 99% of the predicted prime numbers turn
out to be correct. Unfortunately, as M increases, the accuracy declines. For any
M , increasing nmax improves the accuracy, but with additional computational cost.
We emphasize that an nmax of order ln M already yields nontrivial result. To ﬁnd
primes between M and 2M naively by trial division, one would need to know the
primes up to √M , much larger than our logarithmic nmax. The fact that the ﬁrst
ln M primes are enough to predict primes in the long and distant interval from
M to 2M , even imperfectly, is an interesting form of long-range order. Bertrand
famously postulated that there is always a prime number between M and 2M ,
for any value of M . This was proved by Chebyshev using his explicit bounds
towards the prime number theorem, but it remains a diﬃcult algorithmic problem
to ﬁnd primes between M and 2M quickly when M is large. Our reconstruction
procedure does give an algorithm to do so. However, this is not a polynomial-time
algorithm. The reason is that the Fast Fourier Transform scales linearithmically in
the number of sites L, whereas the goal would be complexity polynomial in ln(L).
Step (3) involves testing whether each number up to nmax is square-free, which
up to logarithmic factors takes O(n3/2
max) steps (unless we had a faster way to test
square-free than using trial division up to √
n to factor n). Step (4) takes O(n2
max)
steps, again up to logarithmic factors, using the Euclidean algorithm to ﬁnd greatest
common divisors quickly. Step (5) entails checking the primality of n numbers, for
n up to nmax and computing a sum of length N to ﬁnd C1. The primality testing
can be done quickly and there is some overlap in the numbers that must be checked
as n varies. This step takes O(n2
max + N ) operations. In step (7), we have to check
whether each k = mπ/n with n ≤ nmax is “adjacent”, which involves O(n2
max) cases.
If nmax is negligible compared to N , then the slowest step is (8), where we perform
the inverse Fourier transform of ˜η(k). This step scales as O(L ln L). Thus, at a
computational cost of L ln L operations, we reconstruct the primes with imperfect
accuracy. One could reconstruct with perfect accuracy by simply testing whether
each of the L numbers in the interval is prime. Each primality test takes at most on
the order of ln(M )
6 operations for AKS as adapted by Lenstra and Pomerance [25],
or ln(M )
4 assuming the Riemann Hypothesis to run a deterministic Miller-Rabin
test [33], [40]. Thus our method sacriﬁces accuracy in exchange for a running time
faster by ln(L)
3.
It is interesting to note that when our reconstruction algorithm incorrectly pre-
dicts a composite number as prime, the composite number is usually “almost prime”
in the sense that all of its prime factors are large. For example, our algorithm in-
correctly predicted 1000733 = 809 × 1237 and 1001423 = 887 × 1129 as primes.

HIDDEN MULTISCALE ORDER IN THE PRIMES 29

10. Conclusions and Discussion

The prime numbers display a range of behaviors depending on the interval under
consideration. For dyadic intervals [M, M + L] with L comparable to M , we have
found order across length scales, very diﬀerent from the seeming randomness on
display for smaller L. However, if L were much larger than M , then one would
reach the opposite conclusion of a non-hyperuniform system, purely because of the
density gradient without reference to further properties speciﬁc to the primes. The
substantial order is reﬂected by the existence of dense Bragg peaks, a consequence
of the eﬀective limit-periodicity. The order metric τ gives a quantitative sense in
which the primes are substantially more ordered than the uncorrelated lattice gas
but less ordered than an integer lattice. When L decreases, τ for the primes in this
shorter interval becomes closer to that of an uncorrelated system with a transition
visible at L ∼ ln(M )
2. But the primes in dyadic intervals are hyperuniform, a fact
which would seem almost unbelievable without the eﬀective limit-periodic form for
the structure factor; see Eq. (4.1). Indeed, the primes fall within the same broad
hyperuniformity class as the Riemann zeta zeros (see Fig. 1.1), but are substan-
tially more ordered, having dense Bragg peaks instead of a continuous structure
factor so that, unlike the Riemann zeros, the order metric τ grows with L. These
peaks are located at rational wavenumbers πm/n with odd, square-free denomina-
tor n, and were discovered numerically in [56]. They are explained in terms of the
approximately equal distribution of prime numbers across residue classes modulo
2n. Assuming the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture on prime pairs, the small “diﬀuse
part” observed numerically in Ref. [56] is negligible in the inﬁnite-system limit.
The dense peaks exhibited by the primes are a feature shared with some recently
studied quasicrystals, some also in class II and others with even smaller density
ﬂuctuations, but these other examples have peaks located at irrational wavenum-
bers [37]. The primes are distinctive in being a superposition of periodic systems
subject to irregularities in the distribution of occupied sites, which we call eﬀective
limit-periodicity.
The eﬀective limit-periodic form of the structure factor allows one to predict
the Hardy-Littlewood constants for the frequency with which p and p + r are both
prime. Of course, it remains an open problem to prove a lower bound establishing
that there are inﬁnitely many twin primes. As a more tractable open problem, we
ask what further patterns can be found by considering three-particle and higher
statistics, beyond what we could discern from the two-particle statistics S(k) and
τ . This is related to the full Hardy-Littlewood k-tuples conjecture, going beyond
the case of k = 2 considered here.
Since our analytical formula for the complex density variable ˜η(k), deﬁned by
(2.21), contains phase information, one can employ it to reconstruct a prime-number
conﬁguration within an interval [M, M + L] with L ∝ M by obtaining the inverse
Fourier transform of ˜η(k). This leads to an algorithm that enables the reconstruc-
tion of the primes in such intervals with high accuracy provided that nmax is suﬃ-
ciently large and M is not too large.

Appendix A. The Circle Method of Hardy-Littlewood

For purposes of comparing our approach described in Sec. 4 with the original
approach of Hardy-Littlewood, we review the latter procedure. Their ﬁrst objective
is Goldbach’s problem of writing a given r as a sum of primes p1+. . .+pl rather than
as a diﬀerence. Substantially the same analysis applies to the equations p1 + p2 = n
and p2 − p1 = r. These form an example of what Hardy-Littlewood call conjugate
problems. Instead of a trigonometric polynomial, their generating function is

(A.1) f (x) = ∑

p ln(p)x
p

where the sum is over all primes, not just those in a ﬁnite interval. For the sum to
converge, we must have |x| < 1. It is f (x)
2 that features in Goldbach’s problem,
versus |f (x)|2 for prime pairs. The main theorem of [20] is that, assuming a strong
hypothesis on zeros of Dirichlet L-functions, every suﬃciently large odd number is
a sum of three primes. One can fairly take this hypothesis to be that all zeros of
all Dirichlet L-functions lie on the critical line, namely the generalized Riemann
hypothesis, but Hardy-Littlewood in fact work under the weaker hypothesis of a
certain zero-free strip. The role of the generalized Riemann hypothesis is to ensure
that primes are evenly distributed in arithmetic progressions to such large moduli
as q = √
n, which occur in the Farey dissection used by Hardy-Littlewood. In
the unconditional work of Vinogradov, the denominators grow only as powers of
ln(n) instead of √
n. With or without the Riemann hypothesis, the method fails for
l = 2, and this is why we do not have a proof of (4.1). The main term obtained by
Hardy-Littlewood amounts to nl−1, with errors no greater than nl/2+1/4+ǫ in order
of magnitude. Thus the estimate succeeds if l − 1 > l/2 + 1/4, and so for all larger
l ≥ 3 but not l = 2.
The circle method, aptly named, begins with an integral over a circle |x| = R in
the complex plane:

1
2π
 ∫ 2π

0 f (Re−iψ)f (Re−iψ)eirψdψ = Rr ∑

p apR2p

where ap = ln(p) ln(p+r) if both p and pr are prime, and ap = 0 otherwise. As R →
1, this gives a count of the number of prime pairs. Note that f (Reiψ)f (Re−iψ) =
|f (x)|2. To estimate the integral, Hardy and Littlewood divide the circle into Farey
arcs. The arc ξa,q consists of those x = Reiψ whose argument lies in a particular
interval 2πa
q − θ′
a,q < ψ < 2πa
q + θa,q.

The values of θa,q and θ′
a,q are such that these arcs cover the circle without overlap,
and the length of ξa,q is of order (qN )
−1, N being the last stage to which one carries
out the Farey dissection. This N is what we call qmax. Writing the radius R in the
form R = e−1/n, Hardy and Littlewood choose N = ⌊√
n⌋. On the arc ξa,q, f (x) is
approximated by

(A.2) f (x) ≈ µ(q)
φ(q) 1
1/n − i(ψ − 2πa/q)

with an estimate on the error given by their Lemma 9 p. 19 [20]. The error is
essentially the square root of the main term, provided q ≤ √
n and assuming the

Riemann hypothesis. Changing variables to u = ψ − 2πa/q leads to the simple
expression
 |f (x)|2 ≈ µ(q)
2

φ(q)2 1
1/n2 + u2 .

Integrating over ξa,q then gives

For large n, we may allow the further approximation that

v2 + 1 dv ∼ πn.

The factor π is obtained by replacing the integral with ∫ ∞
−∞(v2 + 1)
−1dv. Note that
θ and θ′ are of order (qN )
−1 ∼ q−1n−1/2, so that nθ ≍ q−1√
n → ∞, while the
exponential eivr/n is close to 1 for n large,
Combining all of the arcs ξa,q such that q ≤ √
n and a ≤ q, with no common
factor between a and q, we ﬁnd that

φ(q)2 e2πiar/qπn = n

To write this in terms of R = e−1/n, note that 1 − R2 = 1 − e−2/n ∼ 2/n. Therefore
∑

p apR2p ∼ 1
1 − R2 S2.

Hardy and Littlewood employ a Tauberian argument to deduce from this behaviour
as R → 1 that ∑

p<n ap ∼ nS2.

The ability to skip this step is one of the technical advantages of working with a
ﬁnite generating function such as S(k) instead of |f (x)|2. Finally, removing the
logarithmic weights in ap, Hardy and Littlewood formulate their Conjecture B: As
n → ∞, the number of prime pairs p, p + r less than n is asymptotic to

n
ln(n)2 2C2 ∏

p|r
 ( p − 1
p − 2
 )

where C2 is their twin primes constant:

C2 = ∏

p>2
(1 − 1/(p − 1)
2).

Hardy and Littlewood rewrite S2 as a product over primes using their Lemma 12
“Summation of the singular series” (p. 27 of [20]):

∞∑

q=1

l

(̟ − 1)l
 ) ∏

p|r
 ( (p − 1)
l + (−1)
l(p − 1)
(p − 1)l − (−1)l
 )

assuming r and l are of the same parity, whereas the sum is 0 if r and l have
opposite parity. In this notation, p refers to an odd prime divisor of r while ̟ is

32 SALVATORE TORQUATO, GE ZHANG, AND MATTHEW DE COURCY-IRELAND

any odd prime, and cq(−r) is Ramanujan’s sum ∑a e−2πiar/q over a modulo q with
no factor in common with q. When l = 2, the product over primes becomes

 ∞∏

̟=3
 (

 ( (p − 1)
2 + (p − 1)
(p − 1)2 − 1
 ) = 2C2 ∏

p|r
 ( p − 1
p − 2
 )

hence the value in Conjecture B. To see why this inﬁnite product agrees with the
sum, imagine multiplying together several terms from the product. Note that all
primes p and ̟ in this formula are odd, the factor 2 having already accounted for
p = 2, which divides r. Each p dividing r introduces a factor (1 + 1/(p − 1)), since
we must incorporate the factor in C2 from ̟ = p. For p not dividing r, the factor
is (1 − 1/(p − 1)
2). The result is a sum over all n = p1 · · · pt, namely odd square-free
numbers.
