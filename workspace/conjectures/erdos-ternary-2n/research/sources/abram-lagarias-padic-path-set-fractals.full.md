P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC

WILLIAM ABRAM AND JEFFREY C. LAGARIAS

Abstract. This paper considers a class of closed subsets of the p-adic integers
Zp obtained by graph-directed constructions analogous to that of Mauldin and
Williams over the real numbers. These sets are characterized as the collection
of those p-adic integers whose points have p-adic expansions describable by
paths in the graph of a ﬁnite automaton issuing from a distinguished initial
vertex. This paper shows that this class of sets is closed under the arithmetic
operations of addition and multiplication by p-integral rational numbers. In
addition the Minkowski sum (under p-adic addition) of two sets in this class is
shown to be a set in this class. These results represent purely p-adic phenomena
in that analogous closure properties do not hold over the real numbers. We
also show the existence of computable formulas for the Hausdorﬀ dimensions
of such sets.
 1. Introduction

This paper studies a distinguished collection C(Zp) of closed subsets of the p-adic
integers Zp, whose members Y are speciﬁed as sets of p-adic integers whose p-adic
expansions are given by inﬁnite labeled paths starting from a ﬁxed initial state of a
a ﬁnite automaton, with edge labels specifying p-adic digits. We term such sets p-
adic path set fractals, because they generally have non-integer Hausdorﬀ dimension,
and because they may be constructed geometrically in a fashion analogous to that
of the (real-valued) geometric graph-directed fractals of Mauldin and Williams [27],
[28], as explained in Section 2.
The set of edge-labeled inﬁnite paths in the graph of an automaton which start
from a ﬁxed state can be studied abstractly in terms of one-sided symbolic dy-
namics, as we consider elsewhere ([2]). Each such set deﬁnes a subset XG(v) of
the symbol space A
N, where A is a ﬁnite symbol alphabet, which is speciﬁed by
a presentation (G, v), in which G is a labeled directed graph with edges labeled
by elements of A, and v is a marked initial vertex of G. We call XG(v) an (ab-
stract) path set. Path sets are closed subsets of the compact set A
N endowed with
the product topology, but they are generally not invariant under the (one-sided)
shift σ : A
N → A
N given by σ(α0, α1, α2, · · · ) = (α1, α2, α3, · · · ). The collection
of path sets is closed under set union and set intersection, but is not closed under
complementation inside the symbol space A
N.
A p-adic path set fractal Y is the image of an abstract path set embedded as a
geometric object inside a p-adic space Zp, using the symbol sequence to obtain the
p-adic digit labeling. More precisely, Y = fp(XG(v)) ⊂ Zp where fp : A
N → Zp is a

(continuous) map that sends a symbol sequence to a set of p-adic digits, using a digit
assignment map ¯fp : A → {0, 1, ..., p− 1}. The digit assignment map ¯fp need not be
one-to-one, consequently a given abstract path set XG(v) has embeddings into each
Zp for every prime p, moreover it typically has diﬀerent embeddings into a ﬁxed Zp,
giving rise to diﬀerent p-adic path set fractals. In the reverse direction any given
p-adic path set fractal can be obtained as the image of diﬀerent abstract path sets
using diﬀerent digit assignment maps. However any p-adic path set fractal Y can
always be obtained by a one-to-one embedding from a suitably chosen path set on
the ﬁxed alphabet A = {0, 1, ..., p − 1}, see Proposition 2.9 below. We call the data
( ¯fp, G, v) a presentation of the p-adic path set fractal, and write Y := ( ¯fp, G, v).
The initial part of this paper gives a formula for the Hausdorﬀ dimension of such
a set Y in terms of the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix of an underlying
automaton of a suitable presentation of Y , described in Section 3. The Hausdorﬀ
dimension of Y = fp(XG(v)) depends on the underlying path set XG(v), the value
of p, and on the digit assignment map fp. We obtain the formula by relating
the p-adic constructions of this paper to the real number constructions of Mauldin
and William, which permit carrying over their formulas for Hausdorﬀ dimension of
(real) graph-directed fractals to the p-adic case.
The main object of this paper is to show that the collection of p-adic path set
fractals C(Zp) is closed under the following operations using p-adic arithmetic:
(1) p-adic addition of a rational number r ∈ Q∩Zp; such r are called p-integral.
(2) p-adic multiplication by a p-integral rational number r;
(3) set-valued addition (Minkowski sum) of two p-adic path sets, using p-adic
addition.
These closure results represent purely p-adic phenomena in the sense that analogous
closure results for applying real arithmetic operations1 fail to hold for Mauldin-
Williams graph-directed fractals over the real numbers. We show that the ﬁnite
automata describing the new sets given by these operations are eﬀectively com-
putable; these new automata depend on the input automata and on the value of p
in a complicated way having a number-theoretic ﬂavor.

1.1. Results. As a preliminary to p-adic results, in Section 2 we review the Mauldin-
Williams construction of graph-directed fractals over the real numbers. We then
formulate an alternate deﬁnition of p-adic path set fractals, deﬁning them geomet-
rically as sets given by a solution of a set-valued functional equation using p-adic
contracting maps (Theorem 2.6 and Deﬁnition 2.7). That is, they are characterized
as a set-valued ﬁxed point of a p-adic graph-directed fractal construction. Then we
establish the equivalence of this geometric deﬁnition to the symbolic dynamics deﬁ-
nition given above, in terms of p-adic expansions describable by a ﬁnite automaton,
i.e. the image of a path set in Zp under a digit assignment map. (Theorem 2.10).
To state results, we need some additional terminology on presentations.
(1) A presentation Y := ( ¯fp, G, v) of a p-adic path set fractal is injective if the
digit assignment map ¯fp is one to one.
(2) A path set presentation (G, v) is right-resolving if the directed graph under-
lying G has the property that at each vertex of the graph, all exiting edges
have diﬀerent labels.

1That is, for addition to and multiplication of a set by rational numbers, or for the Minkowski
sum of two sets.
 P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC 3

(3) A path set presentation (G, v) is reachable if every vertex in G can be reached
by a directed path from v.
All p-adic path set fractals Y have presentations that are injective, right-resolving
and reachable, see Proposition 2.9. We call any such presentation a standard pre-
sentation. In a standard presentation one may always choose to relabel the symbol
alphabet A = {0, 1, 2, ..., p − 1}, and choose the digit assignment map to be the
identity map.
Our ﬁrst result concerns the Hausdorﬀ dimension dH (Y ) of a p-adic path set
fractal Y = fp(XG(v)). We show that dH (Y ) is directly computable from a suitable
presentation of Y as a p-adic path set fractal, and is of an expected form.

Theorem 1.1. (Hausdorﬀ dimension) Let Y belong to C(Zp) and let Y := ( ¯fp, G, v0)
be any standard presentation. Then its Hausdorﬀ dimension dH (Y ) is given by

dH (Y ) = logp σ(A(G)) = log σ(A(G))
log p ,

where σ(A) denotes the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix A = A(G) := [ai,j],
of G, in which ai,j counts the number of directed edges from vertex i to vertex j of
the underlying directed graph of G.

This result is proved in Section 3, where it is deduced from a result relating
these sets to real number graph-directed fractals (Theorem 3.1), where a similar
Hausdorﬀ dimension formula has long been known. We use the fact that Hausdorﬀ
dimension is preserved under the map taking a p-adic expansion of a p-adic integer
to the base p radix expansion of a real number. We show that the image of the
p-adic objects studied here are construction sub-objects of particular real number
constructions of Mauldin and Williams.
The main results of this paper concern p-adic arithmetic operations applied to
p-adic path set fractals. We begin with addition of p-adic rationals.

Theorem 1.2. (Closure under rational addition) Let Y belong to C(Zp). Then for
any p-integral rational number r ∈ Q ∩ Zp, the additively shifted set

Y + r := {y + r : y ∈ Y }

has Y + r ∈ C(Zp).

The proof of this result is constructive and shows that given a standard pre-
sentation Y := (¯ip, G, v) one can directly compute from it a standard presentation
Y + r := (¯ip, G′, v′). The new presentation depends on both r ∈ Q and the value of
p. Theorem 1.2 also follows as a special case of the following result.

Theorem 1.3. (Closure under Minkowski sum) Let Y1, Y2 ∈ C(Zp) be two p-adic
path set fractals in Zp. Then their Minkowski sum-set

Y1 + Y2 := {y1 + y2 : y1 ∈ Y1, y2 ∈ Y2}

has Y1 + Y2 ∈ C(Zp).

The proof of this result is constructive and shows that given standard presen-
tations for Y1 := (¯ip, G1, v1) and Y2 = (¯ip, G2, v2) one can directly construct a
(not necessarily standard) presentation Y1 + Y2 = (¯ip, G3, v3). In the given con-
struction the underlying path set presentation (G3, v3) produced is not necessarily

right-resolving. However there exist standard algorithms to convert any given path
set presentation to one that is right-resolving, see [2, Theorem 3.2].
The statement of Theorem 1.2 can be recovered from Theorem 1.3 as the spe-
cial case that the set Y2 is a one-element set, using the easy observation that the
only path sets in Zp consisting of a single element are those where this element is a
rational r ∈ Q ∩ Zp (Theorem 2.11). However the presentation obtained by the con-
struction of Theorem 1.3 is not necessarily right-resolving, while the construction
given in the proof of Theorem 1.2 is right-resolving.
We next consider multiplication by p-adic rationals.

Theorem 1.4. (Closure under rational multiplication) Let Y belong to C(Zp).
Then for any rational number r ∈ Q ∩ Zp, the dilated set

rY := {ry : y ∈ Y }

has rY ∈ C(Zp).

We prove this result in Section 5. This proof is constructive in the same sense as
Theorem 1.1; given a standard presentation for Y there is (in principle) an algorithm
to ﬁnd a standard presentation for rY . Theorem 1.4 is obtained by concatenation
of constructions for several special cases, as follows.
(1) r = M is a positive integer with gcd(p, M ) = 1. A positive integer has an
inﬁnite p-adic expansion with a ﬁnite pre-period and a periodic part with
all digits 0.
(2) r = 1
M is the inverse of a positive integer M with gcd(p, M ) = 1;
(3) r = −1. Note that −1 has a purely periodic nonterminating p-adic expan-
sion of period 1:

−1 =
 ∞∑

k=0(p − 1)pk = (· · · , p − 1, p − 1, p − 1)p.

(4) r = pk, for k ≥ 1.
Finally we note that, at the level of symbolic dynamics, the arithmetic operations
are not compatible with the one-sided shift operation. That is, if Y is a p-adic path
set which is invariant under the one-sided shift σp : Zp → Zp deﬁned by

σp(
 ∞∑

j=0 αj pj) :=
 ∞∑

j=0 αj+1 pj,

then in general the sets Y + r, rY (for p-integral rational r) will not be invariant
under the one-sided shift σp.

1.2. Extensions and generalizations. In Theorem 1.1 we give a formulas for
Hausdorﬀ dimension of the resulting p-adic path set fractals in terms of the spectral
radius of a nonnegative integer matrix specifying the graph of the underlying path
set. This formula might initially appear unnecessary in the context of the p-adic
arithmetic operations studied, because given any set X ⊂ Zp and any nonzero
α ∈ Zp, rational or not, the sets X, X + α and αX all have the same Hausdorﬀ
dimension. This fact follows since both sets X +α and αX are images of X under bi-
Lipschitz mappings in the p-adic metric. In this context, the usefulness of Theorem
1.1 lies rather in the opposite direction: using it, the known equality of Hausdorﬀ
dimensions yields the equality of the spectral radii of two quite diﬀerent appearing
nonnegative matrices, usually of diﬀerent sizes.

P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC 5

It is of interest that the constructions of this paper will, when given a ﬁxed set X
as input, by varying r yield inﬁnite classes of nonnegative integer matrices having a
ﬁxed spectral radius. This spectral radius always equals the largest real eigenvalue,
which is a particular type of real algebraic integer called a weak Perron number.
Here a weak Perron number is a (positive real) n-th root of a Perron number for
some n ≥ 1, cf. Lind [21], [22]. A Perron number is a real algebraic integer β > 1,
all of whose algebraic conjugates βσ are smaller in modulus, i.e. |βσ| < β. Such
classes of matrices may be worth further study in connection with number theoretic
problems, see Section 7.
The constructions of this paper can be combined with other operations which
preserve the property of being a p-adic path set fractal but which do change the
Hausdorﬀ dimension. For example, path sets are closed under set union and set
intersection ([2, Theorem 1.2]), with the new path set presentations being eﬀectively
computable from the given ones. Set union changes the Hausdorﬀ dimension in a
predictable way, with the new set having dimension equal to the maximum of the
two dimensions, however set intersection changes Hausdorﬀ dimension in seemingly
unpredictable ways. Given presentations of p-adic path set fractals Y1 and Y2 one
can, in principle, compute the Hausdorﬀ dimension of intersections of additive and
multiplicative translates of these sets, such as Y1 ⋂
(Y2 + r) and Y1 ⋂
(rY2). This
study was undertaken to answer questions of this kind that arose in connection with
a problem of Erd˝os, see Erd˝os [12], and papers [19], [3] of the authors. Computed
examples in [3] illustrate that the Hausdorﬀ dimensions of sets Y ∩ (Y + r) and
Y ∩rY vary with r, and the dependence on r of these Hausdorﬀ dimensions appears
to be extremely complicated, with interesting structure.
The class C(Zp) of p-adic path set fractals are closed under another operation:
decimation, i.e. extracting a ﬁxed arithmetic progression of their p-adic digits. We
set ψj,m(α0, α1, α2, · · · ) = (αj, αj+m, αj+2m, αj+3m, · · · ).

and the deﬁne the (j, m)-decimated set

ψj,m(Y ) = {ψj,m(x) : x ∈ Y },

The fact that ψj,m(Y ) set belongs to C(Zp) if Y does follows at the path set level
from [2, Theorem 1.5], which shows that a presentation of ψj,m(Y ) is eﬀectively
computable given a standard presentation of Y . Study of the eﬀect of decimation
operations on Hausdorﬀ dimension of the images seems an interesting topic for
further research.
There are a number of directions for further generalization. The methods of this
paper apply to arithmetic operations applied to the g-adic numbers for arbitrary g ≥
2, as deﬁned by Mahler [25]. As a topological space one has Zg = ∏
p|g Zp. However
when g contains prime powers one would use a g-adic expansion corresponding to
the alphabet A = {0, 1, · · · , g − 1}.
A second generalization is to allow sets in the p-adic numbers Qp, in which
case addition or multiplication of arbitrary rational numbers would be permitted.
One may also generalize the notion of p-adic path sets to higher dimensions, which
would correspond to (Zp)
d. In this case one may investigate various relaxations of
the overlap conditions imposed in the Mauldin-Williams construction. In the real
number analogue Rn results have been obtained by Ngai and Wang [30] and Das
and Ngai [9].

2. Relation to Geometric Graph-Directed Constructions

We ﬁrst describe the Mauldin-Williams geometric graph-directed construction
in the real number case. Then we formulate a (restricted) p-adic analogue to it,
and show that all p-adic path set fractals are obtained by such a construction,
and conversely. The ﬁnal subsection characterizes those p-adic path set fractals
containing exactly one element.

2.1. Mauldin-Williams graph-directed constructions. In the 1980’s Mauldin
and Williams [28] introduced general graph-directed constructions of fractal sets
over the real numbers, and computed their Hausdorﬀ dimensions, see also Edgar
[10, Chap. 4]. We follow the notation established in Mauldin and Williams [28].

Deﬁnition 2.1. A geometric graph-directed construction in Rm consists of:
(G1) a ﬁnite sequence of nonoverlapping2 , compact subsets J1, . . . , Jn of Rm,
such that each Ji has a nonempty interior,
(G2) a directed graph G with vertex set consisting of the integers 1, . . . , n, such
that for each pair (i, j) there is at most one directed edge from i to j.
Additionally, this graph must have the following properties:
(a) For each vertex i, there must be at least one exit edge, i.e. some j
such that (i, j) ∈ G,
(b) The underlying undirected graph must be connected.
(G3) For each graph edge (i, j) there is assigned a similarity map Ti,j : Rm → Rm,
with similarity ratio ti,j such that:
(a) for each i, {Ti,j(Jj)|(i, j) ∈ G} is a nonoverlapping family and

Ji ⊇ ⋃
{Ti,j(Jj )|(i, j) ∈ G} (2.1)

(b) if the path component of G rooted at the vertex i1 is a cycle: [i1, . . . , iq, iq+1 =
i1], then these satisfy the contraction condition

q∏

k=1 tik,ik+1 < 1. (2.2)

Note that in this construction the similarity maps Ti,j will be applied to map
sets in the reverse direction to that of the edges of G.
Now for each i let K(Ji) denote the space of compact subsets of Ji, with the
Hausdorﬀ metric, ρH . Mauldin and Williams prove the following:

2Sets J1 and J2 overlap if their intersection has a nonempty interior.

P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC 7

Proposition 2.2. For each geometric graph-directed construction, there exists a
unique vector of compact sets, (K1, . . . , Kn) ∈ ∏n
i=1 K(Jj) such that for each i,

Ki = ⋃{Ti,j(Kj)|(i, j) ∈ G}. (2.3)

Proof. This is proved by Mauldin-Williams ([28, Theorem 1, p. 812]), using the
results of Hutchinson [16]. Note that the maps Ti,j act in the reverse direction to
that of the edges of G. □

The construction object K is then deﬁned by

K =
 n⋃

i=1 Ki. (2.4)

The individual Kj are the construction sub-objects.
Our deﬁnition of p-adic path sets will correspond to all possible construction
sub-objects Kv in the Mauldin-Williams construction.
Associated to the graph G is an n × n construction matrix A = A(G) (with
n = |V (G)|) given by A = A(G) := [ti,j]1≤i,j≤n, (2.5)
where ti,j is deﬁned to be zero if (i, j) /∈ G. Now for β > 0, set

Aβ = [(ti,j )
β]1≤i,j≤n,

and let Φ(β) := Spectral radius of Aβ .
This is the largest non-negative eigenvalue of Aβ, by the Perron-Frobenius theorem.
Mauldin and Williams [27, Theorem 2] observe that for each construction matrix,
one has
(1) Φ(0) ≥ 1,
(2) Φ(β) is a continuous, strictly decreasing function of β ≥ 0
(3) limβ→∞ Φ(β) = 0.
It follows that there is a unique value α ≥ 0 such that Φ(α) = 1. They term this
value the matrix dimension of the matrix A = AG.
Mauldin and Williams determine the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the construction
object K and also of its individual sub-objects Kj. For the construction object K
it is given as follows.

Proposition 2.3. For each geometric graph-directed construction, the Hausdorﬀ
dimension of K, the construction object, is α, where α is the matrix dimension
of the construction matrix A(G) = [ti,j]1≤i,j≤n, with n = |V (G)|. That is, it is
the unique value α ≥ 0 such that the spectral radius σ(Aα) = 1, where Aβ :=
[(ti,j)
β]1≤i,j≤n for β > 0.

Proof. This is Theorem 3 of Mauldin and Williams [28]. □

Hausdorﬀ dimension formulas for construction sub-objects Kv involve the strongly
connected components of the directed graph G, and use matrices which are square
submatrices of A(G), extracting speciﬁed rows and corresponding columns. A
strongly connected component of a directed graph G is a maximal subgraph that is
strongly connected (i.e. each vertex in the component is reachable from each other
vertex in it by a directed path.) We let SC(G) denote the set of strongly connected
components of the connected graph G. There is a natural partial ordering on SC(G)

8 WILLIAM ABRAM AND JEFFREY C. LAGARIAS

which sets H1 ≼ H2 provided there is a directed path in G from a vertex in H1 to
one in H2. We let αH denote the matrix dimension of the square submatrix AH of
the construction matrix AG corresponding to the strongly connected component H
of G.

Proposition 2.4. For each geometric graph-directed construction, the following
hold.
(1) The Hausdorﬀ dimension of K, the construction object, is α, where

α = max{αH|H ∈ SC(G)}.

Furthermore the set K has positive σ-ﬁnite Hα measure.
(2) The Hausdorﬀ dimension of each construction sub-object Kj is αj, where

αj := max{αH|H ∈ Cj},

where Cj is the set of strongly connected components of G reachable from vertex
j. The sub-object Kj has positive σ-ﬁnite αj -dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure. This
measure is ﬁnite if and only if {H ∈ Cj|αH = αj} consists of (pairwise) incompa-
rable elements in the partial order ≼ on SC(G).

Proof. This statement combines Theorems 4 and 5 of Mauldin-Williams ([28, p.
814, p. 824]). □

2.2. p-adic graph-directed constructions. We formulate a p-adic variant of the
Mauldin-Williams construction inside the compact set Zp as follows.

Deﬁnition 2.5. A (restricted) p-adic graph-directed construction on the p-adic
integers Zp consists of
(P1) a ﬁnite sequence of (identical) initial sets Ji = Zp, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n; these sets
overlap.
(P2) a ﬁnite directed labeled graph G = (G, V, E) with vertex set V consisting
of the integers 1, 2..., n, with E ⊂ V × V × A, with each labeled edge
assigned data (i(e), f (e), je) in which i(e), f (e) ∈ V denote the initial and
ﬁnal vertices of the directed edge, and the label je ∈ A = {0, 1, ..., p − 1}
is drawn from the usual alphabet of p-adic digits. No two edges have the
same data (i, f, j). Each vertex of the underlying directed graph G has at
least one exit edge.
(P3) to the label je is associated a p-adic similarity map φ : Zp → Zp given by

φe(y) = py + je.

This is a contractive mapping in the p-adic metric.

Note that in this construction the similarity maps φe in (P3) will be applied to sets
in the direction reverse to that assigned to the directed graph edge e of G, compare
(2.6) below.
This deﬁnition diﬀers from the Mauldin-Williams real number graph-directed
construction in several ways. Firstly, in condition (P1) it starts with initial sets Ji
that have overlaps, which is forbidden in (G1) of the Mauldin-Williams construc-
tion. Secondly, in condition (P2) the underlying directed graph G (ignoring labels)
is permitted to have loops (i(e) = t(e)) and multiple edges (having same i(e), v(e)),
which are forbidden in (G2). (Mauldin-Williams forbid these conditions in order to
handle maps having diﬀerent contraction rations ti,j on diﬀerent edges.) Thirdly,
condition (P3) requires that all contraction ratios ti,j be equal, which is a narrower

P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC 9

condition than the Mauldin-Williams condition (G3). Furthermore Condition (P3)
implies that analogues of conditions (G3) (a), (b) automatically hold, aside from
the non-overlapping condition:

(a) The initial sets Jj = Zp satisfy the condition

Jj ⊇ ⋃
{φe(Jf (e)) : e = (i(e), f (e)) has initial vertex i(e) = j}.

(b) Each map φe is has p-adic contraction ratio te := |p|p = 1
p < 1. Thus for
[e1, ..., eq, eq+1 = e1] a directed cycle of edges in G, the contracting cycle
condition holds:
 q∏

j=1 tI(ej ),f (ej ) < 1,

The following result gives existence and uniqueness for the p-adic construction.

Theorem 2.6. (p-adic Geometric Graph-Directed Construction) Let G = (G, V, E)
be a connected labeled graph with vertices V = {1, 2, ..., n}, and with edge label
alphabet A = {0, 1, 2, ..., p − 1}. Then there exist unique nonempty compact sets
{Ki : i ∈ V }, each contained in Zp, that satisfy the set-valued functional relations,
for each vertex i ∈ V ,
 Ki = ⋃

{e:i(e)=i} φe(Kf (e)). (2.6)

Proof. This existence and uniqueness of the compact set-valued ﬁxed point (2.6)
follow from Hutchinson [16, Theorem 3.1]. The Hutchison proof establishes that
the Ki are obtained by the following iterative process. We start with initial sets
K (0)
i = Zp, and iteratively deﬁne, for each vertex i ∈ V ,

K (k+1)
i := ⋃

{e:i(e)=i} φe(K (k)
f (e)),

We obtain a sequence of closed sets

K (0)
i ⊇ K (1)
i ⊇ K (2)
i ⊃ · · · ,

and these converge downwards to the compact sets Ki, as n → ∞. □

Deﬁnition 2.7. Any set Y := Ki for some sub-object Ki ⊆ Zp in a (restricted)
p-adic graph directed system is called a geometric p-adic path set fractal. We denote
the set of all such Y ⊆ Zp as CG(Zp).

In Theorem 2.10 below we will show that this deﬁnition gives exactly the same
class of sets as those deﬁned in the introduction, i.e. CG(Zp) = C(Zp).
Many diﬀerent construction pairs (G, v) can produce the same geometric p-adic
path set fractal Y . One can use this freedom to make good choices for G. For ex-
ample, one may require G to be right-resolving, and in addition to have at most one
directed edge between any directed pair of vertices, see the proof of Theorem 3.1(1)
in Section 3.

10 WILLIAM ABRAM AND JEFFREY C. LAGARIAS

2.3. Path sets and p-adic path set fractals. We now show that geometric p-
adic path set fractals in Section 2.2 comprise exactly the same sets as the images
in Zp of abstract path sets under a symbol labeling. We recall a formal deﬁnition
of path set given in [2]. Let A
N be the full one-sided shift space on A. A pointed
graph over an alphabet A consists of a pair (G, v), where G = (G, E) is a ﬁnite
edge-labeled directed graph G, with labeled edges E ⊂ E × A having labels drawn
from an alphabet A, and v a vertex of G. We let V (G) and E(G) denote the set
of vertices and directed edges of G, respectively. Following [2] we make a basic
deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.8. For a pointed graph (G, v) its associated (abstract) path set (or
pointed follower set) P = XG(v) ⊂ A
N is the set of all inﬁnite one-sided symbol
sequences giving the successive labels of all one-sided inﬁnite walks in G issuing
from the distinguished vertex v. Many diﬀerent (G, v) may give the same path set
P, and we call any such (G, v) a presentation of P.

Recall that the class C(Zp) of p-adic path set fractals consists of images fP (P) =
fp(XG(v)) of a path set P under a digit assignment map ¯fp, sending a path address
to a p-adic expansion. We show that the class C(Zp) agrees with the geometric class
CG(Zp) given by the geometric Mauldin-Williams construction. For this purpose it
is helpful to know that every element of C(Zp) has presentation Y := ( ¯fp, G, v) of
the special form called a standard presentation in Section 1.1.

Proposition 2.9. (Standard presentation)
(1) Every path set P = XG(v) on an alphabet A has a presentation (G, v) that is
right-resolving and reachable.
(2) Every p-adic path set fractal Y in C(Zp) has a presentation Y = ( ¯fp, G, v)
that is injective, right-resolving and reachable; that is, a standard presentation.
Furthermore one may specify that the presentation alphabet is A = {0, 1, ..., p − 1}
with the identity digit assignment map ¯ip.

Proof. (1) Any path set X on any alphabet A has a right-resolving, reachable pre-
sentation P = (G, v) on this alphabet, with X = XG(v), by a standard construction,
see [2, Theorem 3.2].
(2) By hypothesis Y ∈ C(Zp) comes with a presentation Y = fp(XG′ (v′)), on
an alphabet A
′. Using the digit assignment map ¯fp : A
′ → {0, 1, ..., p − 1}, we
may relabel the underlying edges of the graph of G′ by the image labels in A =
{0, 1, .., p − 1}, obtaining a labeled directed graph G′′ with Y = ip(XG′′ (v′)). By (1)
the path set XG′′ (v) has another presentation XG(v), in which the new graph G is
right-resolving and reachable, and uses the same label alphabet A. By inspection
Y := (¯ip, G, v′) is still a presentation of Y , and it is injective, right-resolving and
reachable. □

Note the one-sided shift space A
N, for A = {0, 1, ..., p − 1}, topologized with the
product topology, is homeomorphic to Zp with its usual p-adic topology, where one
identiﬁes a symbol sequence α0α1α2 · · · ∈ A
N with the p-adic expansion

x =
 ∞∑

j=0 αjpj = (· · · α2α1α0)p ∈ Zp.

This is exactly the map ip underlying the standard presentation Y = (¯ip, G, v) of a
p-adic path set fractal above.

P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC 11

Now we relate the class C(Zp) to the geometric class CG(Zp). To this end we
note that attached to any labeled directed graph G = (G, V, E) on alphabet A =
{0, 1, ..., p − 1} there is associated a (restricted) p-adic graph-directed construction,
(as in Section 2.2) based on the same graph data G = (G, V, E) where the edge label
j ∈ A is now assigned the map φj (x) = px + j.

Theorem 2.10. There holds CG(Zp) = C(Zp). Speciﬁcally:
(1) Let Kv ∈ CG(Zp) be a construction sub-object of a (restricted) p-adic graph
directed construction with data G = (G, V, E) using edge maps φe = px + je with
0 ≤ je ≤ p − 1, associated to vertex v of G. Create a path set from the same
data G(G, V, E), interpreting the edge labels je ∈ A = {0, 1, ..., p − 1}, and let
Y := ip(XG(v)) be the p-adic path set fractal with presentation Y := (¯ip, G, v).
Then Y = Kv. It follows that CG(Zp) ⊂ C(Zp).
(2) Let Y ∈ C(Zp) be any p-adic path set fractal. Then it has a standard pre-
sentation Y = (¯ip, G, v) with a labeled directed graph G = (G, V, E), having the
additional property that all vertices of the graph G have at least one exit edge. By
(1) there is an associated (restricted) p-adic graph directed construction having a
sub-object Kv, with Y = Kv. Thus C(Zp) ⊂ CG(Zp).

Proof. (1) The correspondence between Kv and Yv proceeds by relating paths to the
address labels of points in the graph-directed fractal, compare Edgar [10, Section
4.3]. We study the set-valued iteration K (k)
i given in Theorem 2.6 for the geometric
p-adic path set fractal determined by G = (G, V, E). We prove by induction on k ≥ 0
that for all vertices i

K (k)
i := ⋃ (
(α0 + α1p + · · · + αk−1pk−1) + pkZp)

where the set union is taken over label sequences (α0, ..., αk−1) of legal walks in the
directed graph G of length k starting from vertex i. (The edge leaving the initial
vertex i has label α0.) The hypothesis that an exit edge exists from each vertex
guarantees that all paths extend one step. The base case k = 0 holds since all
K (0)
i = Zp. For the induction step, we have K (k+1)
i is comprised of sets

φe(K (k)
f (e)) = je +
 k−1∑

i=0 αipi+1 + pk+1Zp

where (α0, ..., αk−1) are labels from a directed walk in G starting from vertex f (e).
But now (je, α0, ..., αk−1) are vertices of a directed walk of length k + 1 starting
from vertex i, and all such walks are enumerated this way. This completes the
induction step. Letting k → ∞, for each vertex i these sets decrease to Ki, which
is now identiﬁed with all inﬁnite walks in G starting from vertex i. Choosing i to
be the original marked vertex, we obtain Ki = ¯ip(XG(v)) = Yv, as asserted.
(2) Given a p-adic path set fractal Y we take a standard form presentation Y =
(¯ip, G′, v). We now prune the graph G′ to remove any vertices with no exit edges,
since such vertices contribute no inﬁnite paths to the path set P = XG(v), and leave
Y unchanged. The new graph may still have vertices with no exit edges, but by
repeating this operation a ﬁnite number of times, we will arrive at a presentation
Y = (¯ip, G, v) in which all vertices have at least one exit edge. The right-resolving
and reachability properties are unaﬀected, so the new presentation is still standard.
The construction of part (1) now applies to give the result. □

12 WILLIAM ABRAM AND JEFFREY C. LAGARIAS

It is known that the class of path sets on a ﬁxed alphabet is closed under ﬁnite
unions and intersections ( [2, Theorem 1.1]). Theorem 2.10 implies that the collec-
tion of p-adic path set fractals C(Zp) is closed under set union and intersection as
well.

2.4. One element p-adic path set fractals. We characterize path sets consisting
of a single element.

Theorem 2.11. (Single element p-adic path set fractals) The p-adic path set frac-
tals Y ∈ C(Zp) that consist of a single element are exactly those Y = {r} for which
r is a p-integral rational number, i.e. r ∈ Q ∩ Zp.

Remark 2.12. This simple result supplies a dynamical characterization of the p-
integral rational numbers r inside Zp.

Proof. Given a p-adic path set fractal Y , assume it is given with a standard pre-
sentation (¯ip, G, v0). Using the pruning construction used in proving Theorem 2.10
we may without loss of generality assume each vertex in G has at least one exit
edge. Such a presentation has an underlying path set XG(v0) consisting of a single
inﬁnite path if and only if there is exactly one exit edge from each vertex, and if
the path is eventually periodic. The latter forces any element r to be a rational
number in Zp. Conversely, we may easily construct a path set consisting of a single
element giving the p-adic expansion of r. □

3. Hausdorff Dimension of p-adic path set fractals

We obtain a formula for the Hausdorﬀ dimension of a p-adic path set fractal Y ,
computable from a standard form presentation of Y . The formula is based on a
Hausdorﬀ dimension relation between p-adic path set fractals and graph-directed
constructions on the real numbers.
To state the result, we note that the adjacency matrix A = A(G) of a directed
graph G is a non-negative integer matrix whose rows and columns are numbered
by the vertices of G (in the same order) with entry Aij counting the number of
directed edges outgoing from vertex i and incoming to vertex j.

Theorem 3.1. (Hausdorﬀ dimension formula) Let Y belong to C(Zp), and suppose
that Y := ( ¯fp, G, v) is a standard form presentation of Y .
(1) The map ιp : Zp → [0, 1] ⊂ R sending α = ∑∞
k=0 αkpk ∈ Zp to the corre-
sponding real number with base p radix expansion

ιp(α) :=
 ∞∑

k=0
 αk
pk+1

is a continuous map. Under this map the image set K0 := ιp(Y ) ⊂ [0, 1] is a
construction sub-object of a Mauldin-Williams graph-directed fractal whose edge
similarity maps are all contracting similarity maps of R with contraction ratio 1/p.
(2) The Hausdorﬀ dimensions of these sets are related by

dH (Y ) = dH (K0).

(3) The Hausdorﬀ dimension

dH (Y ) = dH (K0) = logp α, (3.1)

where α = σ(A(G)) is the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix A = A(G) of the
underlying directed graph G of G.

P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC 13

Remark 3.2. (1) In Theorem 1.9 of [2] the topological entropy of a path set X =
XG(v), with a right-resolving reachable presentation is given by

htop(X) = log σ(A(G)),

where σ(A(G)) is the spectral radius as above. We deduce that for any p-adic path
set fractal Y constructed from X by an injective presentation Y := ( ¯fp, G, v) , its
Hausdorﬀ dimension is
 dH (Y ) = htop(X)
log p .

This extends to path sets a result that is well known in the shift-invariant case
(Furstenberg [14, Proposition III.1]).
(2) The standard presentation assumption for Y above is needed to guarantee
equality of the Hausdorﬀ dimension with logp α. For a general presentation Y :=
( ¯fp, G, v0) of X the adjacency matrix counts the growth rate of number of paths,
which upper bounds the number of distinct sequences of path labels. That is, one
always has
 dH (Y ) ≤ htop(XG(v))
logp ≤ logp σ(A(G)).

(3) The allowed values σ(A(G)) that may occur above are exactly the class of
positive real algebraic integers called Perron numbers, introduced by Lind [21].

Proof. (1) The map ιp : Zp → [0, 1] is surjective and one-to-one away from a
countable set. It is continuous because the p-adic topology is strictly ﬁner than the
comparable topology on base p expansions of real numbers.
We are given a standard presentation of Y = (¯ip, G, v), where without loss of
generality the alphabet A = {0, 1, ..., p − 1}. The graph G is right-resolving and
reachable, but this will not be suﬃcient to obtain a Mauldin-Williams construction
for the image of XG(v) preserving symbol sequences. We need a standard presenta-
tion with extra properties. We call a presentation right-separating if the underlying
directed graph G of G has no multiple edges.
Claim. There exists a presentation Y = (¯ip, G, v) in which G is both right-
resolving and right-separating.
To show the claim, given a right-resolving presentation (G′, v′), we show it may
be converted to a right-separating presentation by making use of a vertex-splitting
construction, as follows. Suppose that a vertex v of G′ has k ≥ 2 labeled edges from
a vertex w, which necessarily has distinct labels. We create a new labeled graph G′′

that retains all vertices of G except v and replaces v by k vertices v(i), 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
Case 1. w ̸= v.
In this case we assign a single new labeled edge from w to each v(i) such that
as i varies, the corresponding edge labels exhaust the k labels of edges from w to
v. The exit edges assigned each v(i) each duplicate the exit edges from v, both in
multiplicity and in labels, with self-loops of v corresponding to self-loops of v(i).
The entering edges to v(1) will all be the same in multiplicity and in labels as for v,
while for v(i) with i ≥ 2 there will be no entering edges from the rest of the graph,
with the exception of self-loops, assigned as above. Finally all edges between any
two vertices distinct from the v(i) will be the same as in the original graph.
Case 2. w = v
In this case v has k self-loops, which have distinct labels since the right-resolving
property is assumed. We may identify the k loop labels with {1, 2, ..., k} in some

14 WILLIAM ABRAM AND JEFFREY C. LAGARIAS

ﬁxed fashion, and then assign a directed edge from v(i) to v(j) with edge label
corresponding to i + j (mod k), for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k. The other exit edges assigned
each v(i) will duplicate the exit edges of v, in multiplicity and labels (excluding
self-loops). The entering edges of v(1) will be the same in multiplicity and labels as
for v (excluding self-loops). All other v(i) have no entering edges coming from any
other vertices of the original graph v′ ̸= v.
Now that G′′ is constructed, we assert that the path sets from all states (G′′, w′)
for w′ ̸= v(i) agree with those of (G′, w′), while all path sets (G′′, v(i)) agree iden-
tically with that of (G′, v). This assertion may be established by viewing G′ as a
covering of G which preserves edge labels, which has the k vertices v(i) lying above
vertex v, and all other vertices agreeing. One may check that each edge in G′ from
a given initial vertex v′ lifts uniquely to a suitable vertex and edge above it in G′′

(here v′ = w is the only interesting case), except that self-loops from v lift to a
self-loop for any initial vertex v(i). After the ﬁrst step, any path lifts uniquely to
G′′. Conversely any labeled path in the lifted graph projects to an allowable labeled
path in G′. The assertion follows.
This construction has the feature that the new graph G′′ is still right-resolving.
In consequence the construction may be repeated. In doing so, we must eventually
arrive at a right-resolving presentation that is also right-separating. To see this,
assign to each vertex an integer invariant that is the product of the multiplicities
of all entering edges. When a vertex is split, this invariant decreases for all of the k
descendants v(i), and remains the same for all other vertices of the graph. By the
well-ordering of N, the splitting procedure will eventually halt at a right-separating
presentation. This establishes the claim.

We have now obtained a standard presentation that is also a right-separating
presentation (¯ip, G, v) of Y . By pruning vertices with no exit edges (repeating the
operation ﬁnitely many times, as necessary), we may obtain such a presentation
in which additionally each vertex has at least one exit edge. Associated to G are
|V (G)| path sets XG(w), w ∈ V (G), and corresponding Yw := ip(XG(w)) ∈ C(Zp).
We now proceed to map these sets to real image sets which are corresponding
graph-directed constructions. For convenience we re-number the vertices of G, 0 ≤
i ≤ n, where n = |V (G)| − 1, with vertex 0 corresponding to the original v. We
map the individual sets Yj under the map ιp + 2j to the image sets

Kj := ιp(Yj) + 2j ⊂ [2j, 2j + 1].

The integer shifts by 2j make all sets Kj disjoint in R; Thus K0 = ι(Y ).
We show below that the sets (K0, K1, · · · , Kn) are the complete set of construc-
tion sub-objects of a particular Mauldin-Williams graph-directed construction. The
integer shifts made above enforce the non-overlapping condition needed in that con-
struction.
We set up a Mauldin-Williams geometric graph-directed construction in R, which
has construction object K contained in the compact set [0, 2n], for which the sets
(K0, K1, ..., Kn) will form the construction sub-objects. The initial sets will be
Jj = [2j, 2j + 1] for 0 ≤ j ≤ n; they satisfy the non-overlapping property (G1).
It uses the same directed graph G as that of G. The graph G has all the correct
properties (G2) to be a graph in the Mauldin-Williams construction: it is connected,
has at most one directed edge between any ordered pair of vertices (by the right-
separating property), and each vertex has at least one exit edge. To each directed

P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC 15

labeled edge e = [i1, i2] of G with label je and map φe we associate the real-valued
map
 Te(x) = Ti1,i2 (x) := 1
p
 ((x − 2i2) + j) + 2i1.

This map is a similarity with contraction ratio 1/p, and note that

Ti1,i2 (Ji2 ) ⊂ Ji1 . (3.2)

Now condition (G3)(a), that the sets {Ti,j(Jj ) : e = (i, j)} are non-overlapping for
each i, holds as a consequence of the right-resolving property of G. The second
condition Ji ⊇ ⋃
{Ti,j(Jj )|(i, j) ∈ G
∗}

follows from (3.2). Finally condition (G3)(b) holds since every map Te(x) is a strict
contraction.
By the basic theorem of Hutchinson [16, Theorem 3.1], this construction has
a unique compact attractor K consisting of a collection of disjoint compact sub-
objects {Kj : 0 ≤ j ≤ n}, and it remains to verify that

K0 = ιp(Y ).

The sets Kj are obtained by the Mauldin-Williams (iterative) geometric graph-
directed construction using [28, Theorem 1], starting with the (disjoint) initial sets
Jj := [2j, 2j + 1]. After m-iterations, we have sets J (k)
j which for ﬁxed j form
nested sequences of compact sets, each having nonempty interior. We then obtain
the limit objects Kj := ⋂
k J (k)
j . The Mauldin-Williams construction object is
K = ∪0≤j≤nKj. One can prove by induction on k that

J (k)
i = 2j + ⋃ ( α0
p + α1
p2 + · · · + αk−1
pk + 1
pk [0, 1])
.

where the set union runs over all symbol sequences of length k on the labeled
directed graph G starting from vertex i. From this construction one sees that
K0 = ιp(Y ) since K0 ⊂ [0, 1] and the underlying symbol sequences of Y and of K0
agree. Moreover one sees that Kj ⊂ [2j, 2j + 1] and all the construction sub-objects
satisfy Kj = (ιp)(Yj ) + 2j, 0 ≤ j ≤ n.
(2) The deﬁnition of p-adic Hausdorﬀ dimension is quite similar to Hausdorﬀ
dimension for real numbers on the interval [0, 1], cf. Abercrombie [1]. An ǫ-covering
of Y ⊂ Zp is a covering of Y by a countable collection of p-adic open balls all having
diameter at most ǫ. and considers the quantities

mβ(Y ) := lim
ǫ→0
 ( inf
ǫ−cover(Vol(B(xi, ǫi)))
β),

in which the data {(xi, ǫi) : i ≥ 1} describes the covering, specifying center xi and
radius ǫi of p-adic disks, with all 0 < ǫi ≤ ǫ, and Vol(S) denotes the usual p-adic
measure of S ⊂ Zp. There is a cutoﬀ value β0 such that mβ(Y ) = ∞ for β > β0 and
mβ(Y ) = 0 for β < β0; this is the Hausdorﬀ dimension of Y . We use the following
basic fact, following [19, Section 3.2 ].
Claim. The mapping ιp : Zp → [0, 1] which sends a p-adic number λ =
(· · · α2α1α0)p to the real number with base p expansion .α0α1α2 · · · is continuous
and one-to-one oﬀ a countable set. This mapping preserves Hausdorﬀ dimension,
i.e dH (Y ) = dH (ιp(Y )).

16 WILLIAM ABRAM AND JEFFREY C. LAGARIAS

To verify the claim, note that one can expand each set in a p-adic covering of a
set Y to a closed-open disk

B(m, pj) = {x ∈ Zp : x ≡ m (mod pj)}

(which has diameter 1
pj ), with at most a factor of p increase in diameter, and
similarly one can inﬂate any real covering to a covering with ternary intervals
[ m
pj , m+1
pj ] with at most a factor of p increase in diameter. But these special intervals
are assigned the same diameter under their respective metrics, and this can be used
to show the Hausdorﬀ dimensions of Y and ι(Y ) coincide. (The Hausdorﬀ measures
of the resulting sets is not proved to coincide by this argument.)
The truth of the claim immediately yields dH (K0) ≡ dH (ι(Y )) = dH (Y ), as
asserted.
(3) We are given a standard presentation Y = (¯ip, G, v0) of the p-adic path set
fractal Y .
Assume ﬁrst that this presentation is right-separating. In that case we can
directly apply the formulas of Mauldin-Williams to the construction made in (1).
The set Kv0 is connected by directed paths to every vertex of the graph G, so that
the vertex set C1 = SC(G) consists of all strongly connected components of G. By
Proposition 2.4 the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the sub-object Kv0 is then the same as
that of the full construction object K = ⋃
v Kv.
The Hausdorﬀ dimension of the full object K can now be computed using Propo-
sition 2.3. In our case all nonzero maps for G are similarities with constant ratio
1/p, which yields the formula for the scaled construction matrix

Aβ = [tβ
i,j]1≤i,j≤n = ( 1
p )
βAG,

in which AG is the adjacency matrix of the directed graph G, given by

AG = [mi,j]1≤i,j≤n

where mi,j counts the number of directed edges from vertex v to vertex w. Now set

Φ(β) := Spectral radius of Aβ ,

and the special form of Aβ yields
 Φ(β) = λ0p−β,

in which λ0 is the spectral radius σ(AG). By Proposition 2.3 the full construction
object has Hausdorﬀ dimension
 dH (K) = α

where Φ(α) = 1. This requires

α = logp λ0 = logp σ(AG),

the desired formula.
It remains to treat the general case, in which the intial standard presentation
Y = (¯ip, G, v0) is not necessarily right-separating. We show that the formula for
Hausdorﬀ dimension continues to hold. To handle this case, we study the eﬀect of
the state-splitting construction introduced earlier to convert a right-resolving pre-
sentation (G′, v′) of a path set to a presentation (G, v0) that is also right-separating.

P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC 17

It suﬃces to show that every step of this procedure yielding a graph (G′′, v′) pre-
serves the value of the spectral radius (Perron eigenvalue) of the associated non-
negative integer matrix AG′′ . If this is shown, then the already proved formula for
the Hausdorﬀ dimension for the p-adic path set associated to (G, v0) will carry over
to that for (G′, v′).
To check that the spectral radius is preserved under this operation, we use the
known fact that the spectral radius of a nonnegative matrix A is given by

σ(A) = lim
k→∞(Nk(A))
1/k,

in which Nk(A) = eT A
ke, where e = [1, 1, .., 1]T is a column vector. Here Nk(A)
counts the number of directed paths of length k between all pairs of vertices of A.
(The existence of the limit is part of the assertion.) We use the fact that G′′ is a
covering of G′ and that all (labeled) paths of G′ lift uniquely to paths of G′′, with
the exception of paths that have starting vertex v, which have s distinct lifts, where
s was the number of vertices of G that were split. From this we conclude that

Nk(AG′ ) ≤ Nk(AG′′ ) ≤ sNk(AG′ ).

Since s is constant, we conclude that

σ(A(G
′)) ≤ σ(AG′′ ) ≤ lim
k→∞ s1/kNk(AG′ )
1/k = σ(AG′ ),

giving the result. □

Proof of Theorem 1.1. This result is immediate from Theorem 3.1, combining (2)
and (3). □

4. p-adic addition and path set fractals

We analyze the eﬀect on p-adic path set fractals of addition of p-integral rational
numbers r ∈ Q, viewing Q as a subﬁeld of Qp. We describe algorithms which when
given a presentation (G, v0) of a path set Y , will produce a presentation of Y + r.

4.1. Sum of a path set and a p-integral rational number. Theorem 1.2 is
an immediate corollary of the following stronger result. Recall that a p-integral
rational number r is any r ∈ Q ∩ Zp.

Theorem 4.1. Let Y belong to C(Zp), and suppose it has a standard presentation
Y := (¯ip, G, v0) having V vertices. Suppose also that r is a p-integral rational
number, which has a p-adic expansion with pre-periodic part of length Q0 and a
periodic part of period Q. Then the additively shifted set Y ′ := Y + r ∈ C(Zp), and
it has a right-resolving presentation having at most 2p(Q0 + Q)V vertices.

Proof. We give an explicit construction of a presentation for Y + r which certiﬁes
it is a p-adic path set fractal, starting from a given standard presentation.
Suppose ﬁrst that we are in the special case where r has a purely periodic p-adic
expansion (· · · c2c1c0)p , of period Q, with cj+Q = cj, and write

r =
 ∞∑

j=0 cjpj = ( Q−1∑

j=0 cjpj)( ∞∑

k=0 pkQ)
.

We aim to construct a standard presentation Y ′ = (¯ip, G′, w0) and show that
Y ′ = Y + r. (At the level of symbols we may identify Y ′ with the underlying path

18 WILLIAM ABRAM AND JEFFREY C. LAGARIAS

set P ′ = (G′, w0) since the identity map matches them.) The vertex states of G′

will be labeled w = (v, f, e, a), in which:

(i) v denotes a vertex of G;
(ii) f denotes a place-marker in the periodic portion of the p-adic expansion of
r, and saisﬁes 0 ≤ f ≤ Q − 1;
(iii) e keeps track of the current amount of carry-digit information not yet in-
corporated in the sum-set p-adic expansion,
(iv) a with 0 ≤ a ≤ p − 1 denotes an edge label value.

The initial vertex will be w0 = (v0, 0, 0, 0). We will establish the upper bound e ≤ 2
on the maximum size of a carry-digit in the analysis below.
The exit edges of G′ map a vertex w to w′ = (v′, f ′, e′, a′) in which there is a
directed labeled edge (v, v′) ∈ G, with label ℓ1 satisfying ℓ1 = a′, and the value
f ′ ≡ f + 1 (mod Q). The edge label ℓ′ assigned to this edge will be 0 ≤ ℓ′ ≤ p − 1
with ℓ′ ≡ e + ℓ1 + cf (mod p), (4.1)

and the value e′ is required to satisfy

e′ = 1
p (
e + ℓ1 + cf − ℓ′). (4.2)

Finally we deﬁne the graph G′ to consist of all states reachable from the initial
vertex w0, and all edges constructed between these states.
We ﬁrst show that all reachable vertices satisfy the carry-digit bound e ≤ 2; this
shows that the graph G′ is ﬁnite and also bounds its size. The carry-digit bound
is proved by induction on the number of steps n along a directed path. The base
case n = 0 has e = 0. For the induction step, using the rule above

e′ = 1
p (
e + ℓ1 + cf − ℓ′) ≤ 1
p (
2 + (p − 1) + (p − 1)
) ≤ 2,

completing the induction step. We conclude in this case that G′ has at most 2p(Q −
1)V vertices.
We next show that the presentation Y ′ = (¯ip, G′, w0) is a standard presentation.
We ﬁrst check that G′ is right-resolving. To see this, note that the exit edges from
a vertex w correspond to exit edges from vertex v in the right-resolving graph G,
whence any two edges have diﬀerent values of ℓ1. Now the exit edge label ℓ′ is an
invertible linear function of ℓ1 by (4.4), since the values e and cf are ﬁxed by w,
so all exit edges have distinct labels, as asserted. This graph G′ is reachable from
vertex w0 by construction, so we have a standard presentation.
We next observe that a lifted path in G′ uniquely determines the path in G it
lies over. This follows since the path label value ℓ1 is uniquely recoverable from
the path label ℓ′ and the vertex data on G, using (4.5), since e′ is known and cf is
known from the vertex label f . The underlying path on G determines the quantity

yn =
 n−1∑

k=0 akpk, i = 1, 2,

corresponding to the initial part of the p-adic expansion of a value y ∈ Y being
determined by the G-path. (The values ak are the successive labels ℓ1 along the
G-path.) Conversely, each path in G with initial vertex v0 lifts to a unique path

P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC 19

in G′ with initial vertex w0. Given a vertex w, a labeled edge (v, v′) with label ℓ1
determines the values a′ = ℓ1 and e′ a unique vertex w′ that w connects to.
We now show that for an inﬁnite path in G determining y ∈ Y , the labels of
the lifted path in G′ suﬃce to compute the associated value y′ ∈ Y ′. We prove
this by induction on n, for the n-step initial path. The successive edge labels
{ℓ′
i : 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1} of the lifted path in G′ with the end vertex data e′ = en
determine the quantity
 y′
n :=
 n−1∑

k=0 ℓ′
kpk + enpn.

We establish by induction on n that

y′
n−1 = yn−1 + rn−1, (4.3)

in which
 rm :=
 m−1∑

j=0 ckpk,

is a truncated version of the p-adic expansion of r. The base case n = 1 is clear.
By the induction hypothesis,

yn + rn = (yn−1 + rn−1) + an−1pn−1 + cn−1pn−1

= ( n−2∑

k=0 ℓ′
kpk + en−1pn−1) + an−1pn−1 + cn−1pn−1

= ( n−1∑

k=0 ℓ′
kpk) + enpn,

the last equality holding by virtue of (4.5), using cf = cn−1 and ℓ1 = an. This
completes the induction step, proving (4.3).
Now the lifted path data yields the p-adic limit

lim
n→∞
 n−1∑

k=0 ℓ′
kpk = lim
n→∞
(yn + rn) − lim
n→∞ enpn = y + r.

We conclude that the lifted path of G′ corresponding to y ∈ Y determines the point
y′ := y + r ∈ Y ′. It follows that Y ′ = Y + r, as asserted. This completes the
argument in the case that r has a purely periodic p-adic expansion.
It remains to treat the general case where r has a preperiodic part, say length
Q0. We must extend the construction above and upper bound the number of states
in the constructed presentation (G, w). The extension is routine: we add extra
vertices w := (v, dj , e, a) to G, in which v denotes a vertex of G, dj marks the
j-th preperiodic digit of r, 1 ≤ j ≤ Q0. The exit edges of G′ map a vertex to
w′ = (v′, dj+1, e′, a′) in which there is a directed labeled edge (v, v′) ∈ G, with label
ℓ1 satisfying ℓ1 = a′. The edge label ℓ′ assigned to this edge will be 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ p − 1
with ℓ′ ≡ e + ℓ1 + dj (mod p), (4.4)

and the value e′ is required to satisfy

e′ = 1
p
 (
e + ℓ1 + dj − ℓ′ ). (4.5)

20 WILLIAM ABRAM AND JEFFREY C. LAGARIAS

The ﬁnal preperiodic digit exit edges go to vertices w := (v′, f0, e′, a′) in the earlier
set.
It is straightforward to check that the underlying labeled graph has the right-
resolving property. Next one must check this extension preserves the lifting property
of paths, we omit the details.
Finally we must upper bound the total number of vertices in the graph (G, w).
One ﬁnds that the preperiodic part contributes at most 2Q0V p vertices, and the
periodic part contributes at most 2QV p vertices. □

Remark 4.2. The key features in this proof are: (i) the p-adic carry digits propagate
to higher powers of p and do not disturb earlier p-adic digits; (ii) the size of the
carry digits is bounded above. Property (i) fails in real number arithmetic, and
there is no real number analogue of this result.

4.2. Minkowski sum of two p-adic path sets. We show that the Minkowski
sum of two p-adic path set fractals is itself a path set, establishing Theorem 1.3.
This proof is constructive, but it no longer produces a right-resolving presentation.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. We suppose that Y1 := (¯ip, G1, v1) and Y2 := (¯ip, G2, v2)
come with standard presentations. We use these presentations to directly construct
a presentation Y ′ := (¯ip, G1,2, w0), which is not necessarily standard, and show that
Y ′ = Y1 + Y2, the Minkowski sum, certifying membership in C(Zp).
To begin the construction, G1,2 will have vertices labeled w := (vj,1, vk,2, e, a)
where vj,1 ∈ V (G1), vk,2 ∈ V (G2), and e ≥ 0 is an integer encoding carry-digit
information, and 0 ≤ a ≤ p − 1 speciﬁes an allowed edge entry label in G+
1,2.
The exit edges from a given vertex w go to a new vertex w′ = (vj′,1, vk′,2, e′, a′)
in which
(a) there is a directed edge of G1 from vj,1 to vj′,1 having label ℓ1 satisfying
ℓ1 = a′;
(b) a directed edge of G2 from vk,2 to vk′,2 with label ℓ2, and
(c) the constructed edge is assigned the label ℓ, 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ p − 1, determined by

ℓ ≡ e + ℓ1 + ℓ2 (mod p), 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ p − 1

(d) the new carry-digit is

e′ = 1
p (
e + ℓ1 + ℓ2 − ℓ) ≥ 0.

The initial pointed vertex of the graph G1,2 is w0 := (v0,1, v0,2, 0, 0). We now
deﬁne G1,2 to consist of all vertices above reachable from w0 by some directed
path. We show this is a ﬁnite graph by establishing that that the “carry-digit” in
any reachable vertex satisﬁes e ≤ 2. This follows by induction on the length of the
path. The base case is n = 0 where e = 0. For the induction step, we upper bound
the new value of e via

e′ = 1
p
 (
e + ℓ1 + ℓ2 − ℓ) ≤ 1
p
 (
2 + (p − 1) + (p − 1)
) ≤ 2,

completing the induction step. We then insert all edges between these vertices
produced in the construction above.
To see that Y ′
1 = Y1 + Y2, we prove by induction on n ≥ 0 that being at a vertex
w at step n, having gotten a speciﬁed series of edge labels, following a given lifted
path implies that:
 P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC 21

(1) the steps and vertices of the lifted path have suﬃcient information to re-
construct two paths of input y1 and y2 producing that path;
(2) the ﬁrst n p-adic digit symbols of y1 + y2 have been correctly computed by
symbols of the steps of the path so far, namely that if

yi,n =
 n−1∑

k=0 ak,ipk, i = 1, 2,

then
 y1,n + y2,n =
 n−1∑

k=0 bkpk + epn,

where e = en is the current carry-digit, and the bi are the edge labels
produced so far in the graph G+
1,2.

Suppose that the next directed edge moves to a vertex w′ = wn+1, with data
(e′, a′). Then we have a′ = ℓ1 = an,1 and

e′ = 1
p (
ℓ1 + ℓ2 − ℓ + e) = 1
p (
a + ℓ2 − ℓ + e)

Since e, a, ℓ are known, this equation uniquely determines the label ℓ2 = an,2. Since
both G1 and G2 are right-resolving, the edges (j, j′) and (k, k′) with the labels
an1, an,2 are legal steps which uniquely determine the edges updating y1,n, y2,n to
y1,n+1, y2,n+1. Now the deﬁnition of edge labels in G1,2 assigns the label bn := ℓ to
the edge of G1,2 and e′ = en+1 in

y1,n+1 + y2,n+1 =
 n∑

k=0 bkpk + e′pn,

completing the induction step. □

Remark 4.3. The presentation Y1 + Y2 = (¯ip, G+
1,2, w0) in this construction is gener-
ally far from right-resolving. This occurs because some values y = y1 + y2 ∈ Y1 + Y2
may have more than one representation (y1, y2). This construction produces a sep-
arate path for each pair (y1, y2), so more than one path can yield the same sequence
of labels.
 5. p-adic multiplication and path set fractals

5.1. Multiplication by p-integral rational numbers. We give constructive
proof for multiplication by rational numbers of speciﬁc types.

Theorem 5.1. Let Y belong to C(Zp) and suppose it has a standard presentation
(¯ip, G, v0) having V vertices. Let M ≥ 2 be a positive integer with gcd(p, M ) = 1.
(1) For r = M the multiplicatively shifted set Y ′ := M Y ∈ C(Zp). It has a
right-resolving presentation having at most (M + 1)V vertices.
(2) For r = 1
M the multiplicatively shifted set Y ′ := 1
M Y ∈ C(Zp). It has a
right-resolving presentation having at most (M + 1)V vertices.
(3) For r = −1 the multiplicatively shifted set Y ′ := −Y ∈ C(Zp). It has a
right-resolving presentation having at most 2V vertices.
(4) For r = pk, k ≥ 0, the multiplicatively shifted set Y ′ := pkY ∈ C(Zp). It has
a right-resolving presentation having at most k + V vertices.

22 WILLIAM ABRAM AND JEFFREY C. LAGARIAS

Proof. We are given Y ∈ C(Zp), with a standard presentation Y = (¯ip, G, v0), in
which G has V vertices. For each given r we give an explicit construction of a
standard presentation Y ′ := (¯ip, G′, w0) and establish that Y ′ = rY in each case.
The constructions in cases (1)-(3) are similar.
(1) Here r = M with p ∤ M , and we construct a presentation Y ′ of a p-adic path
set fractal and show Y ′ = M Y . We start with an (inﬁnite) graph G′′ whose vertices
will be pairs w = (v, e), in which v is a vertex of G, and e ≥ 0 is a carry-digit.
The initial vertex is w0 := (v0, 0). The exit edges from a vertex w to a vertex
w′ = (v′, e′) will occur only if there is at least one edge from v to v′. Given such
an edge of G with label ℓ, we assign a corresponding edge of G′with label ℓ′ given
by
 ℓ′ = M ℓ + e (mod p), 0 ≤ ℓ′ ≤ p − 1, (5.1)

which is well-deﬁned since (p, M ) = 1. We require that the new carry digit be

e′ := 1
p (
e + M ℓ − ℓ′)
. (5.2)

We deﬁne (G′, w0) to the graph obtained taking all vertices reachable from w0
in the above construction. We prove that all reachable vertices have carry-digit
0 ≤ e ≤ M by induction on the number of steps n on a minimal path to such a
vertex. The base case n = 0 is true, since e = 0, and the induction step follows by
observing from (5.2) that
 e′ ≤ 1
p (
M + M (p − 1)
) ≤ M.

We conclude that the graph G′ has at most (M + 1)V vertices.
We now set Y ′ = (¯ip, G′, w0), and ﬁrst show this presentation is standard. We
ﬁrst claim that G′ is right-resolving. We argue by contradiction. If not, there
would be two exit edges of some vertex w = (v, e) of G having the same value of
ℓ′. But then by (5.1) the underlying edges of (G, v0) would have the same value of
ℓ, contradicting the right-resolving property of (G, v0). By construction (G′, w0) is
reachable, hence this presentation of Y ′ is standard.
It remains to show that Y ′ = M Y . Consider an inﬁnite path in G, with image

y∞ =
 ∞∑

j=0 ℓjpj ∈ Y.

We assert the corresponding output path

y′
∞ =
 ∞∑

j=1 ℓ′
jpj ∈ Y ′

has
 y′
∞ = 1
M y∞.

We verify this by induction on the length of a ﬁnite path approximating y∞. Let
v0, v1, ..., vn be states on a path in sG with edge labels ℓ0, ℓ1, ℓn−1. Associated to
this path is
 yn = ℓ0 + ℓ1p + · · · + ℓn−1pn−1.

P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC 23

By construction we obtain
 y′
n =
 n−1∑

j=0 ℓ′
jpj.

Now we prove by induction on n ≥ 1 that

y′
n = M yn + enpn

where en = e′, where e′ is the carry value at the ﬁnal vertex vn. The base case
n = 1 is clear, and for the induction step (en = e, en+1 = e′) we get, using (5.2),

M yn+1 = M (
yn + ℓnpn) = y′
n + (en + M ℓn)pn = y′
n + en+1pn+1

Now we use |enpn|p → 0 as n → ∞, whence M y′
∞ = y∞, establishing the result.
(2) Here r = 1
M with p ∤ M , and we construct a presentation Y = (¯ip, G ′ , w0) of
1
M Y . We start with a (inﬁnite) graph GM , whose vertices will be pairs w = (v, e),
in which v is a vertex of G, and e ≥ 0 is a carry digit, initially unbounded. The
initial vertex is w0 := (v0, 0). The exit edges from a vertex w = (v, e) to a vertex
w = (v′, e′) will occur only if there is at least one edge in G from v to v′. Given
such an edge of G with label ℓ, we assign a corresponding edge of G′with label ℓ′

given by M ℓ′ = ℓ − e (mod p), 0 ≤ ℓ′ ≤ p − 1, (5.3)

which is well-deﬁned since (p, M ) = 1. We require that the new carry digit be

e′ := 1
p (
e + M ℓ′ − ℓ)
. (5.4)

We now deﬁne (G′, w0) to be the graph obtained by including only the vertices
reachable from w0 in the above construction. We now show all reachable vertices
have carry-digit 0 ≤ e ≤ M , by induction on the number of steps n on a minimal
path to such a vertex. The base case n = 0 holds since e = 0, and the induction
step follows by observing from (5.4) that

e′ ≤ 1
p
 (
M + M (p − 1)
) ≤ M.

We conclude that the graph G′ has at most (M + 1)V vertices.
We now deﬁne the p-adic path set fractal Y ′ := (¯ip, G′, w0), and ﬁrst show this
presentation is standard. To show G′ is right-resolving, we argue by contradiction.
If not, there would be two exit edges of some vertex w = (v, e) of G having the
same value of ℓ′. But then by (5.3) the underlying edges of (G, v0) would have the
same value of ℓ, contradicting the right-resolving property of (G, v0). It is reachable
by construction, so it is a standard presentation.
It remains to establish that Y ′ = 1
M Y , still supposing (p, M ) = 1. Consider an
inﬁnite path in G, with image
 y∞ =
 ∞∑

j=0 ℓjpj ∈ Y.

We assert the corresponding output path

y′
∞ =
 ∞∑

j=1 ℓ′
jpj ∈ Y ′

24 WILLIAM ABRAM AND JEFFREY C. LAGARIAS

has
 y′
∞ = 1
M y∞.

We verify this by induction on the length of a path starting from the initial vertex.
Let v0, v1, ..., vn be vertices on a path in G with edge labels ℓ0, ℓ1, ℓn−1. Associated
to this path is yn = ℓ0 + ℓ1p + · · · + ℓn−1pn−1.

By construction we obtain
 y′
n =
 n−1∑

j=0 ℓ′
jpj.

Now we prove by induction that
M y′
n = yn + enpn

where en = e′ is the carry value at the ﬁnal vertex vn. For the induction step
(en = e, en+1 = e′)) we get, using (5.4)

M y′
n+1 = M (
y′
n + ℓ′
npn) = yn + (en + M ℓ′
n)pn = yn+1 + en+1pn+1

Now we use |enpn|p → 0 as n → ∞, whence M y′
∞ = y∞ establishing the result.
(3) Given a standard presentation of Y := (¯ip, G, v0), we construct a standard
presentation Y ′ := (¯ip, G′′, w0) which has Y ′ := −Y , as follows.
The vertices of G′ will be pairs w = (v, e), in which v is a vertex of G, and e is a
carry digit, which may take values 0 or −1. The initial vertex will be w0 := (v0, 0).
The exit edges from a vertex w to a vertex w′ = (v′, e′) will occur only if there is
at least one edge in G from v to v′. Given such an edge of G with label ℓ, we assign
to it a corresponding edge of G′ from w to w′ with label ℓ′ given by

ℓ′ = −ℓ + e (mod p), 0 ≤ ℓ′ ≤ p − 1, (5.5)

If the current vertex has e = 0 and ℓ = 0, then the new vertex has ℓ′ = 0 and is
assigned carry digit e′ = 0. If either e = −1 or if e = 0 and ℓ > 0, then the new
carry digit e′ = −1. Once a path in G′ reaches a vertex with carry digit e′ = −1,
all subsequent vertices reached have carry digit −1. Note that when e = −1 we
have −p ≤ −ℓ − 1 ≤ −1 and ℓ′ = p − ℓ − 1.
We now let G′ denote the part of the graph above reachable from the initial
vertex w0. This graph has at most 2V vertices. We then insert all edges between
reachable vertices produced in the construction above.
We now set Y ′ := (¯ip, G′, w0), and as before check that this is a standard presen-
tation. We claim that G′ is right-resolving. This is clear since the label ℓ′ on exit
edges from a vertex w are in one-one correspondence with labels on exit edges in G
from the associated vertex v, via (5.5). The graph G′ is reachable by construction.
It remains to show that Y ′ = −Y . We let yn = ∑n−1
j=0 ℓjpj and

y′
n =
 n−1∑

j=0 ℓjpj.

We have y′
n = yn = 0 as long as the carry digit e = 0. Let ℓr − 1 be the ﬁrst nonzero
digit on the path, where the carry digit switches to −1. From then on switches to

P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC 25

e = −1, we have

y′
n = (p − ℓr−1)pr−1 +
 n−1∑

j=r(p − ℓj − 1)pj = −yn + pn.

Letting n → ∞ we obtain y′
∞ = −y∞, establishing the result.
(4) Let r = pk with n ≥ 1. For k ≥ 0 the set pkY consists of modifying all symbol
sequences in Y by adding k initial zeros. A standard presentation Y ′ = (¯ip, G′, w)
for this set is easily obtained. Let G′ consist of G with the addition of k new vertices
wj (0 ≤ j ≤ k − 1). Each of the new vertices has a single exit edge from wj to
wj+1 assigned label 0, for 0 ≤ j ≤ k − 2, and a similar exit edge labeled 0 from
wk−1 to v0. The start vertex of G′ is w0, and G′ has k + V vertices. □

Remark 5.2. Theorem 5.1 excluded the case “multiplication by pk with k < 0, since
these maps do not have range in Zp.

5.2. Proof of Theorem 1.4. Theorem 1.4 follows immediately from Theorem 5.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.4. Let r be a p-integral rational number, i.e. ordp(r) ≥ 0. We
may factor r = (−1)
apk M1
M2 , in which a ∈ {0, 1}, k ≥ 0 and gcd(p, M1M2) = 1.
Now we successively apply the constructions in Theorem 5.1 to multiply Y by 1
M1 ,
next multiply the resulting set by M2, next multiply the resulting set by (−1)
a,
and ﬁnally multiply the resulting set by pk. □

6. Examples

In the following examples, we let Σp(D) denote the p-adic integer Cantor set
consisting of all p-adic integers whose digits are drawn from a given set
D ⊆ {0, 1, · · · , p − 1}. All Σp(D) ∈ C(Zp), and have Hausdorﬀ dimensions

dH (Σp(D)) = logp |D| = log |D|
log p .

Example 6.1. This example concerns adding a p-integral rational number r to the
3-adic Cantor set Y01 := Σ3({0, 1}), whose 3-adic expansions omit the digit 2. It
has a right-resolving presentation as a 3-adic path set by the pointed labeled graph
(G, 0) pictured in Figure 1.
 00 1

A = ( 2 ) ,
whose Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue is 2, hence the Cantor set Σ3({0, 1}) has Haus-
dorﬀ dimension dH (Σ3({0, 1})) = log3 2, as stated above.
Now we consider the eﬀect of additively shifting by r = 2. The construction
of Section 4.1 applied to the presentation above yields the p-adic path set fractal
presentation of Y01 + 2 = Σ3({0, 1}) + 2, given in Figure 2, denoted

Y01 + 2 = i3(XG′ (0200)).

 .

The eigenvalues of A
′ are 2 and 0 (multiplicity 3), so we see the Perron eigenvalue
is 2. Thus the Hausdorﬀ dimension is

dH (Y01 + 2) = log 3
log 2 = dH (Y01)

Here Y01 + α for any α ∈ Z3 must have the same Hausdorﬀ dimension, because
they are bi-Lipschitz equivalent, hence their adjacency matrices must have the
same Perron eigenvalue. Note that only a countable set of values of α can give
Y01 + α ∈ C(Z3), since C(Z3) is a countable set.

Example 6.2. We consider the eﬀect of set addition on 5-adic Cantor sets Σ5(D)
for certain subsets of digits D. For all sets of two digits, we have dH (Σ5({a, b}) =
log5 2. Set Yi,j := Σ5({0, i}) + Σ5({0, j}), for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 4.

P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC 27

One can show that log5 3 ≤ dH (Xi,j) ≤ log5 4. (6.1)
We ﬁnd by inspection that the sums of certain Cantor sets are themselves Cantor
sets: Y1,1 := Σ5({0, 1}) + Σ5({0, 1}) = Σ5({0, 1, 2})
Y1,2 = Σ5({0, 1}) + Σ5({0, 2}) = Σ5({0, 1, 2, 3})
These examples have Hausdorﬀ dimensions dH (Y1,1) = log5 3 and dH (Y1,2) =
log5 4, respectively, and they show that the bounds in (6.1) are sharp. Much more
interesting are the sets Y2,3 and Y1,4, which are not Cantor sets; here the p-adic
carry operations occuring during addition in the set sum destroy the Cantor set
property. To compute their Hausdorﬀ dimension, we ﬁrst ﬁnd p-adic path set
presentations for them by the construction of Theorem 1.3. These presentations
are not right-resolving, but we then apply the subset construction method in [2,
Section 2] to obtain a right-resolving presentation. We omit the details, noting only
that for Y1,4 we ﬁnd the resulting graph has ﬁve vertices and adjacency matrix

A14 =

Its Perron eigenvalue is 2 + √
2. Computing its Hausdorﬀ dimension by the formula
of Theorem 3.1, we obtain

dH (Y1,4) = log5(2 + √
2) ≈ log5(3.41412).

A similar construction for Y2,3 leads to

dH (Y2,3) = log5(2 + √
3) ≈ log5(3.73205).

Example 6.3. We consider on the eﬀect on the 3-adic Cantor set Y01 := Σ3({0, 1})
of a multiplicative translation by r = 1
4 . The set 1
4 Y01 has a presentation (H, 00)
obtained from that of Σ3({0, 1}) given by (G, 0), using the construction given in
Section 5.1. This presentation is shown in Figure 3.

This matrix has Perron eigenvalue 2, and it has three other smaller nonzero eigen-
values, one real and two conjugate complex. Using the formula in Theorem 3.1(3)
we obtain dH ( 1
4 Y01) = log3 2.

Example 6.4. In this example we consider the eﬀect of intersecting multiplicatively
translated Cantor sets taken from Example 6.3. Let

Y := 1
4 Y01 ∩ Y01 = Σ3({0, 1}) ∩ 1
4 Σ3({0, 1}).

We obtain by the method of [2, Section 4] applied to the presentations above the
presentation of (H′, 000) shown in Figure 4, where H′ is the label product H′ =
G ⋆ H, as deﬁned in [2, Section 4].

 .

Remark 6.5. In [3] we will study intersections of multiplicative translates of 3-adic
Cantor sets in much more detail.

7. Concluding Remarks

The constructions of this paper may prove interesting from the viewpoint of
nonnegative integer matrices and their eigenvalues. By Theorem 1.1 the Hausdorﬀ
dimension is given by the base p logarithm of the spectral radius of the underlying
adjacency matrix of a standard path set presentation graph, which is a nonnegative
integer matrix. As noted in Section 1.2, for nonzero r ∈ Q∩Zp the maps X ↦→ X +r
and X ↦→ rX preserve Hausdorﬀ dimension. On the level of path set presentations
these constructions therefore produce inﬁnitely many diﬀerent integer matrices, of
varying dimensions, all having the same spectral radius, plus various eigenvalues of

P -ADIC PATH SET FRACTALS AND ARITHMETIC 29

The spectral radius of a nonnegative matrix is always attained by a nonnegative
real eigenvalue, according to the Perron-Frobenius theory. In the special case of
nonnegative integer matrices A this maximal eigenvalue is a real algebraic integer
β, and if A is not nilpotent, then β ≥ 1. It is termed the Perron eigenvalue in
Lind and Marcus [23, Deﬁnition 4.4.2]. This eigenvalue is necessarily a weak Perron
number, which is deﬁned to be any positive n-th root of some Perron number ([22])
for some n ≥ 1; a Perron number is any real algebraic integer β ≥ 1 which is strictly
larger in absolute value than all of its conjugates. Lind [21, Theorem 1] showed
that the Perron eigenvalue of any aperiodic nonnegative integer matrix is a Perron
number, and that conversely every Perron number occurs as the Perron eigenvalue of
some aperiodic nonnegative integer matrix. More generally the Perron eigenvalue
of any non-nilpotent nonnegative integer matrix is a weak Perron number, and
conversely every weak Perron number occurs as the Perron eigenvalue of at least
one such matrix. Perron numbers appear as the topological entropies of Axiom A
diﬀeomorphisms via a result of Bowen [7], see [21, p. 288].
The constructions in this paper could be of interest in investigating and produc-
ing examples of graphs with a ﬁxed Perron eigenvalue, particularly in case where
this eigenvalue is very close to 1. In order to produce nonnegative matrices that
have a given Perron number β as spectral radius, it is sometimes necessary to take
a nonnegative matrix of dimension strictly larger than the degree of the minimal
polynomial of θ, see an example given in Lind [20], [21, Section 3]. In such cases
the characteristic polynomial of this matrix must contain extraneous eigenvalues.
The constructions of this paper oﬀer a method to generate interesting examples of
this kind. Such graph constructions might also conceivably be useful in investigat-
ing conjectures on the smallest Perron number of each degree, a topic studied in
Boyd [8] and Wu [32]. A more speculative direction would be relating the structure
of such graphs in connection with Lehmer’s conjecture on the Mahler measure of
irreducible polynomials.
