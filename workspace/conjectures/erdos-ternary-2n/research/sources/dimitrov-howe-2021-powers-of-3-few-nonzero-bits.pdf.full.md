POWERS OF 3 WITH FEW NONZERO BITS
AND A CONJECTURE OF ERD ˝OS

VASSIL S. DIMITROV AND EVERETT W. HOWE

ABSTRACT. Using completely elementary methods, we find all powers of 3 that can be written as the
sum of at most twenty-two distinct powers of 2, as well as all powers of 2 that can be written as the sum
of at most twenty-five distinct powers of 3. The latter result is connected to a conjecture of Erd˝os, namely,
that 1, 4, and 256 are the only powers of 2 that can be written as a sum of distinct powers of 3.
We present this work partly as a reminder that for certain exponential Diophantine equations, elemen-
tary techniques based on congruences can yield results that would be difficult or impossible to obtain
with more advanced techniques involving, for example, linear forms in logarithms.

1. Introduction

To introduce our topic, we begin with some numerical observations. For an integer x ≥ 0, consider
the binary representation of 3x. In Table 1 we give this representation for x ≤ 25, and we tabulate the
number of bits in the binary representation together with the number of those bits that are equal to 1.
Based on this limited data, it looks like about half of the bits of the binary representation of 3x are
equal to 1, which is what one would expect if 3x were to behave like a random integer of the appropriate
size. Computations with larger values of x seem to indicate that the fraction of 1s does tend toward
1/2 as x increases to infinity, but proving that this is the case seems far beyond the reach of existing
techniques.
A much weaker observation is that as x goes to infinity, the number of 1s in the binary representation
of 3x tends to infinity as well; that is, one would certainly be tempted to guess that there are only
finitely many x such that the binary representation of 3x contains fewer than ten 1s, or a hundred 1s, or
any given finite number of 1s. This observation is in fact true, and was proven by Senge and Straus in
1973; their result [20, Theorem 3, p. 100] implies that for any given n, there are only finitely many
x such that the binary representation of 3x has n or fewer bits equal to 1. In 1980 Cameron Stewart
proved an effective version of this result [21, Theorem 1, p. 64] — which means that given a value
of n, Stewart’s arguments produce a bound B(n) so that if x > B(n), then 3x has more than n bits equal
to 1. Unfortunately, the values of B(n) produced by Stewart’s method grow very quickly; for example,
we can show
1 that B(22) > 4.9×1046.

log log log 3x) for some positive constant C. We only get a stronger upper bound on x if we solve for x when C = 0, and this
is how we get our lower bound for B(22).

In this paper, we use completely elementary techniques to find all powers of 3 whose binary
representations have at most twenty-two bits equal to 1. In fact, these powers of 3 are exactly the ones
displayed in Table 1.

Theorem 1.1. The only powers of 3 that can be written as the sum of twenty-two or fewer distinct
powers of 2 are 3x, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 25.

In other words, there are more than twenty-two 1s in the binary representation of 3x exactly when
x > 25. Clearly, this bound is much smaller than the one obtained from Stewart’s theorem!

POWERS OF 3 WITH FEW NONZERO BITS 3

We also look at the complementary problem of finding powers of 2 whose base-3 representations
contain no 2s and at most twenty-five 1s. Stewart’s theorem applies here as well, and says that if 2x

can be expressed in this manner, then x is less than a computable bound that is larger than 5.4×1054.
Our result shows that in fact x ≤ 8.

Theorem 1.2. The only powers of 2 that can be written as the sum of twenty-five or fewer distinct
powers of 3 are:
 20 = 30

22 = 30 + 31

28 = 30 + 31 + 3
2 + 35.

Put differently, if x ̸∈ {0, 2, 8} then the base-3 representation of 2x will contain either at least one 2, or
at least twenty-six 1s. This provides a tiny bit of confirmation for a conjecture of Erd˝os [15, Problem 1,
p. 67], which states that the only powers of 2 whose base-3 representations contain only 0s and 1s
are the three examples given in Theorem 1.2. (For work on Erd˝os’s conjecture and closely related
problems, see for example [5, 14, 17, 18] and the papers these articles cite.)
Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 can be expressed in terms of exponential Diophantine equations. In particular,
Theorem 1.1 gives us all solutions of

(1) 3
x = 2a1 + · · · + 2an, x ≥ 0, 0 ≤ a1 < · · · < an

for n ≤ 22, and Theorem 1.2 gives us all solutions to

(2) 2
x = 3a1 + · · · + 3an, x ≥ 0, 0 ≤ a1 < · · · < an

for n ≤ 25.
Our method for solving equations (1) and (2) involves considering the equations modulo M for a
sequence of well-chosen moduli M, each one dividing the next. We will postpone our discussion of
what “well-chosen” means, and for now we will simply illustrate our method with an example.
Let us look at the case n = 3 of equation (1). We start by considering the related problem of writing
a power of 3 as the sum of three powers of 2 in the finite ring Z/M1Z for M1 = 5440 = 26 · 5 · 17,
where we no longer insist that the powers of 2 be distinct. The following diagram enumerates the
powers of 2 modulo M1; here the arrows indicate multiplication by 2.

We see there are 14 distinct powers of 2 modulo M1, and likewise we find that there are 16 distinct
powers of 3. Using a computer to enumerate sums of three powers of 2 in Z/M1Z, we find that (up to

POWERS OF 3 WITH FEW NONZERO BITS 4

the order of the summands) there are only three ways to write a power of 3 in Z/M1Z as a sum of three
powers of 2:
 31 ≡ 20 + 20 + 20 mod M1(4)
 32 ≡ 20 + 22 + 22 mod M1(5)
 34 ≡ 20 + 24 + 26 mod M1.(6)

For each of the summands 2i on the right-hand side of one of these equations, we can ask for the
exponents b such that 2b ≡ 2i mod M1. Looking at diagram (3), we see that for i = 0, 2, and 4, the only
exponent b with 2b ≡ 2i mod M1 is i itself, because 1, 4, and 16 are all on the “tail” of the diagram.
On the other hand, the exponents b with 2b ≡ 26 mod M1 are {6, 14, 22, 30, . . .} = {6 + 8 j : j ≥ 0},
because the “loop” part of diagram (3) goes around in a cycle of 8 steps.
Every solution to equation (1) with n = 3 must reduce modulo M1 to one of the three equations (4),
(5), or (6). However, no solution to equation (1) can reduce to (4), because the summands in (1) would
have to be 20, 20, and 20, which are not distinct. Likewise, no solution to equation (1) can reduce
modulo M1 to (5), because two of the summands in (1) would have to be 22. Therefore, every solution
to equation (1) with n = 3 reduces modulo M1 to (6), and we see that two of the summands in (1) must
be 20 and 24.
Now we consider information modulo M2 = 27 · 5 · 17 · 257. If a solution to equation (1) reduces
modulo M1 to (6), what can it reduce to modulo M2? There are 16 powers of 3 in Z/M2Z that reduce to
34 in Z/M1Z, namely 34, 34+16, . . . , 34+15·16, and there are 3 powers of 2 in Z/M2Z that reduce to 26

in Z/M1Z, namely 26, 214, and 222. We check that in Z/M2Z neither 20 + 24 + 214 nor 20 + 24 + 222 is
equal to any of the possible powers of 3. However, 34 ≡ 20 + 24 + 26 in Z/M2Z.
Therefore, every solution to equation (1) with n = 3 must reduce modulo M2 to the congruence
34 ≡ 20 + 24 + 26 mod M2. But we check that 20, 24, and 26 lie on the tail of the analog of diagram (3)
for M2, so the only powers of 2 in the integers that reduce to 20, 24, and 26 modulo M2 are 20, 24, and
26 themselves. We see that if there is a solution to equation (1) with n = 3, the right-hand side must be
20 + 24 + 26. As it happens, in the integers this sum is equal to 34, so 34 = 20 + 24 + 26 is the unique
solution to equation (1) with n = 3.
This simple example displays the basic idea that we use to prove Theorem 1.1. For such a small
example we could have started by considering the equation modulo M2, instead of first looking
modulo M1, but for larger examples it is much more efficient to cut down the solution space by looking
first at small moduli before building up to larger ones.
Solving exponential Diophantine equations using congruence arguments is not a new technique.
In 1976, for example, Alex [2] used congruences to find all solutions to x + y = z, where x, y, and z
are mutually coprime integers divisible by no prime larger than 7. In 1982, Brenner and Foster [10]
presented a whole bestiary of exponential Diophantine equations that can be solved in this way. (They
mention in particular that Alex found all solutions to our example 3x = 2a1 + 2a2 + 2a3 using “a few
small moduli,” although this had been solved earlier by Pillai, as we discuss below.) In 2009, ´Ad´am,
Hajdu, and Luca [1] used a result of Erd˝os, Pomerance, and Schmutz [16] to show that for every finite
set S of primes and finite set A ⊂ Z of coefficients, the number of integers less than x that can be written
as the sum of a fixed number of terms of the form as, where a ∈ A and s ∈ Z is a product of powers of

POWERS OF 3 WITH FEW NONZERO BITS 5

primes in S, grows more slowly than a specific power of log x. Independently, in a 2011 paper [12] we
studied representations of integers as sums of terms of the form ±2a3b, which is the case A = {±1},
S = {2, 3} of the problem studied in [1]. We presented one way of finding moduli M that could be used
to prove that certain integers cannot be represented by a given number of such terms, and we used the
same result of Erd˝os, Pomerance, and Schmutz to show that there is a positive constant c such that
infinitely many integers n cannot be written as a sum of fewer than c log n/(log log n log log log n) such
terms.
In 2016 Bert´ok and Hajdu [7] studied exponential Diophantine equations in general, again using
arguments based on [16], and they conjectured that if an exponential Diophantine equation has only
a finite number of solutions2 and satisfies some other natural restrictions, then there is an integer M
such that the solutions to the equation modulo M lift uniquely to the solutions in Z. In a later paper [8]
the same authors generalized this conjecture to number fields. One can view our work in this paper as
providing evidence in support of the Bert´ok–Hajdu conjectures.
Our main contribution in this paper is the method we describe for choosing a sequence of moduli
that allows us to refine the collection of solutions modulo M, for larger and larger M, until every
solution modulo M can be lifted to at most one solution in the integers. Our moduli are chosen in a
careful order that makes each refinement step computationally feasible. The closest predecessor to our
technique seems to be the method used by Bert´ok and Hajdu in [7], in which they choose a modulus
M and then piece together information gleaned from solutions to the original Diophantine equation
modulo the prime power divisors of M. Another new observation in this paper appears in Section 3,
where we show that any modulus M that provides us with all solutions to equation (1) or (2) must
satisfy an unexpected condition.
We study the problem of writing powers of 2 as sums of distinct powers of 3, as well as the
complementary problem of writing powers of 3 as sums of distinct powers of 2, for several reasons.
First, these problems are simply-stated and natural. Second, we wanted to see what we could say about
Erd˝os’s conjecture. Third, we were curious how far the modular methods discussed by Brenner and
Foster can be pushed, since even modest laptop computers are much more powerful than anything
available at the time their paper was written. And finally, we hope to bring these straightforward modular
techniques to the attention of the community of mathematicians who are interested in exponential
Diophantine equations.
As a historical note, we observe that the solutions to the case n = 2 of equations (1) and (2) were
determined nearly seven centuries ago by Levi ben Gerson [4], who showed that the only pairs of
integers of the form 2r3s that differ by 1 are (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), and (8, 9). A paraphrase of ben
Gerson’s argument, more legible
3 than [4], is given in [11, Appendice, pp. 183–191]. One way to prove
ben Gerson’s theorem is to observe that every solution to ben Gerson’s problem is a solution to the
case n = 2 of either equation (1) or equation (2), and then to consider those two equations modulo 80.
In 1945, Pillai [19] found all solutions to ±(2x − 3y) = 2X + 3Y ; taking either x or y to be 0 leads to
the solutions for the case n = 3 of equations (1) and (2). Between 2011 and 2013, Bennett, Bugeaud,
and Mignotte [5, 6] used linear forms in two logarithms to find all perfect powers whose binary

2The statement of the conjecture [7, p. 849] only applies to Diophantine equations with no solutions, but later in the paper
the authors show how the conjecture, if true, can be applied to equations that have finitely many solutions.

representations have at most four bits equal to 1 (extending a result of Szalay [22] that gives all perfect
squares with at most three bits equal to 1), and this solves the case n = 4 of equation (1). These are all
of the previous solutions to cases of equations (1) and (2) that we are aware of; however, the paper of
Bert´ok and Hajdu [7] discussed earlier includes solutions to many very similar equations, including,
for example, finding all powers of 17 that can be expressed as the sum of nine distinct powers of 5.
Surely their methods could have been used to solve some more instances of equations (1) and (2).
The structure of this paper is as follows: In Section 2 we briefly review some notation. In Section 3
we observe that in some situations there will necessarily be solutions to equations (1) or (2) modulo M
that are not reductions of solutions in the integers, unless some specific conditions on M hold. These
conditions shape our strategy of choosing a specific sequence of moduli to use in the proofs of
Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. In Section 4 we give examples of two different ways of lifting solutions to (1)
modulo M1 to solutions modulo M2, suitable for two different circumstances. These examples help
clarify the process by which we proved Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. We present the proofs of these theorem
in Sections 5 and 6.
The programs we used to complete our calculations were written in Magma [9] and are available as
supplementary material attached to the ArXiv version of this paper [13]. They are also available on the
second author’s web site.

2. Notation and conventions

In this paper we will often want to count or enumerate the number of solutions to an exponential
Diophantine equation modulo M, but there is some natural ambiguity as to what this might mean.
For instance, there are infinitely many pairs of integers x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 for which the congruence
3x ≡ 2y + 5 mod 28 holds, but for every such x and y we have 3x ≡ 9 mod 28 and 2y ≡ 1 mod 28, so it
might not be unreasonable to say that there is only one solution. In order to avoid any confusion, we
remove this ambiguity by adopting the following convention.

Convention 2.1. When we count or enumerate solutions to an exponential Diophantine equation
modulo M, we will consider two solutions to be the same if the corresponding terms in the equation
are congruent modulo M.

This means, for example, that for the congruence 3x ≡ 2y + 5 mod 28 we consider the solutions
(x, y) = (2, 2), (x, y) = (8, 2), and (x, y) = (8, 5) to be the same, because in each case 3x ≡ 9 mod 28
and 2y ≡ 4 mod 28.
This convention does have one drawback, which is that for some exponential Diophantine equation
modulo M, there truly are only finitely many integer solutions. For example, the only integers x ≥ 0
and y ≥ 0 such that 3x ≡ 2y + 5 mod 216 are x = 2 and y = 2. This distinction will in fact be important
to us, so we make the following definition.

Definition 2.2. Let M > 0 be an integer and p a prime. We say that a power of p, say pi, is determinate
modulo M if the only integer b ≥ 0 with pb ≡ pi mod M is b = i; otherwise, we say that pi is an
indeterminate power of p modulo M.

POWERS OF 3 WITH FEW NONZERO BITS 7

Thus, we will say that the congruence 3x ≡ 2y + 5 mod 28 has one solution, namely 32 ≡ 22 +
5 mod 28, but that 32 is an indeterminate power of 3 modulo 28 and 22 is an indeterminate power of 2
modulo 28. On the other hand, 3x ≡ 2y + 5 mod 216 also has only one solution, but the power of 3 and
the power of 2 involved are both determinate.
Given a prime p and an integer M > 0, we can construct a diagram like diagram (3) of the powers of
p modulo M. Note that a determinate power of p modulo M is exactly a power of p that lies on the tail
of this diagram, and a straightforward argument shows that for i ≥ 0, the integer pi is a determinate
power of p modulo M if and only if M is divisible by pi+1.
Recall that if M is a positive integer then the group of units in the ring Z/MZ has order ϕ(M),
where ϕ is the Euler ϕ-function, which can be computed using the formula ϕ(n) = n ∏p|n(1 − 1/p);
see [3, §2.3, §2.5]. Also, if M is an odd prime power then the group of units in Z/MZ is cyclic [3,
Theorem 10.4, p. 207].
For every prime p, we let vp be the p-adic valuation function, so that vp(M) is the largest x such
that px divides M. And lastly, we set some notation related to the behavior of the numbers 2 and 3 in
finite rings.

Notation 2.3. Let M be a positive integer and write M = 2u3vM′, where u = v2(M) and v = v3(M), so
that M′ is coprime to 6.

• We let O2(M) be the multiplicative order of 2 in the ring Z/3vM′Z.
• We let O′
2(M) be the multiplicative order of 2 in the ring Z/M′Z.
• We let O3(M) be the multiplicative order of 3 in the ring Z/2uM′Z.
• We let O′
3(M) be the multiplicative order of 3 in the ring Z/M′Z.

We see, for example, that there are v2(M) + O2(M) elements in the tail-and-loop diagram of
the powers of 2 modulo M, with v2(M) in the tail and O2(M) in the loop. Similarly, there are
v3(M) + O3(M) elements in the tail-and-loop diagram of the powers of 3 modulo M.

3. Extraneous solutions to congruences

The basic heuristic behind our strategy for solving instances of equations (1) and (2) is that if M is
large and there are very few powers of 2 in Z/MZ and very few powers of 3 in Z/MZ, then there
should be very few “extraneous” solutions to equations (1) or (2) modulo M — that is, solutions that
are not the reduction modulo M of a solution in the integers. If M is divisible by sufficiently high
powers of 2 and/or 3, we can hope that every solution modulo M to equation (1) or (2) will involve
only determinate powers of 2 or of 3 modulo M (where determinate is as defined in Section 2). If this
is the case, then each solution will lift uniquely to the integers, if it lifts at all. However, it turns out
that for many moduli M, if there is any solution to one of these equations, then there is also a solution
that includes indeterminate powers of 2 and of 3.
For example, we saw in the introduction that if M1 = 5440 = 26 · 5 · 17 then the equation 3x ≡
2a1 + 2a2 + 2a3 mod M1 has the three solutions given by (4), (5), and (6), and we see that (6) involves
an indeterminate power of 2 (and of 3). If we look at the same equation modulo M2, where M2 = 2M1 =
27 · 5 · 17, then we find four solutions, including 320 ≡ 20 + 24 + 214, and this involves indeterminate
powers of 2 and of 3 modulo M2. When we look at the same equation modulo M3, where M3 =

POWERS OF 3 WITH FEW NONZERO BITS 8

41M2 = 27 · 5 · 17 · 41, there is once again a solution with indeterminate powers of 2 and 3, namely
320 ≡ 20 + 24 + 246. And the same happens yet again when we work modulo M4, where M4 = 193M3 =
27 · 5 · 17 · 41 · 193.
And yet in the introduction, when we considered solutions to 3x ≡ 2a1 + 2a2 + 2a3 modulo 27 · 5 ·
17 · 257, we did not wind up with extraneous solutions. What is the difference between 27 · 5 · 17 · 257
and 27 · 5 · 17 · 41 · 193?
The following proposition, which uses Notation 2.3, explains one way in which solutions with
indeterminate powers of 2 or 3 can arise, and suggests a condition that we will want to impose on the
moduli we use.

Lemma 3.1. Let M be a positive integer. Suppose x > 2, y > 0, and c are integers such that 3y ≡
c + 2x mod M. If O′
3(M) is not divisible by 2x−1 and O′
2(M) is not divisible by 3y, then there are
integers x′ ≥ 0 and y′ ≥ 0 such that

(a) 3y′ ≡ c + 2x′ mod M,
(b) 2x′ is an indeterminate power of 2 modulo M, and
(c) 3y′ is an indeterminate power of 3 modulo M.

Lemma 3.1 shows that in the example we presented in the introduction, it was necessary for us to
use a modulus divisible by a prime (in our case, 257) for which either the order of 3 is divisible by 25

or the order of 2 is divisible by 34. Since 34 = 20 + 24 + 26, if we use a modulus M that is divisible by
27 (so that 20, 24, and 26 are determinate powers of 2 modulo M), Lemma 3.1 shows that there will be
other, extraneous, solutions modulo M unless M is divisible by such a prime.

Proof of Lemma 3.1. Write M = 2u3vM′ where M′ is an integer coprime to 6, and set o2 = O′
2(M) and
o3 = O′
3(M). First we claim that there is an integer s such that y + so3 > v and 3y+so3 ≡ c mod 2u.
Suppose u ≤ x, so that 3y ≡ c mod 2u. We know that 3s ≡ 1 mod 2u if s is a multiple of ϕ(2u), so
we can simply take s to be a large enough multiple ϕ(2u) so that y + so3 > v, and this s meets the
conditions of our claim.
Suppose u > x. Then M is even, and since c differs from 3y by a multiple of the even number M,
we see that c must be odd. Therefore there is an integer d such that cd ≡ 1 mod 2u. Choose such a d
and consider the integer z = 1 + 2xd, which is congruent to 1 mod 8 because x > 2. If we apply part 1
of Lemma 3.2 (below) to this z, we find that there is an integer e0, divisible by 2x−2, such that every
integer e with e ≡ e0 mod 2u−2 satisfies 3e ≡ 1 + 2xd mod 2u. By assumption, the highest power of 2
that divides o3 is at most 2x−2. Therefore there is an integer s such that so3 ≡ −e0 mod 2u−2, and we
can choose such an s that is large enough so that y + so3 > v.
We have 3−so3 ≡ 1 + 2xd mod 2u. Multiplying both sides of this congruence by c 3so3 gives
c ≡ (c + 2x)3so3 mod 2u, and since c + 2x ≡ 3y mod M and hence also modulo 2u, we find that
c ≡ 3y+so3 mod 2u. Thus, this s has the properties we desire, and we have proven our claim.
Similarly, using part 2 of Lemma 3.2, we can show that there is an integer r such that x + ro2 > u
and 2x+ro2 ≡ −c mod 3v.
Let x′ = x + ro2 and let y′ = y + so3. We claim that this x′ and y′ satisfy conditions (a), (b), and (c)
from the lemma. It is easy to check conditions (b) and (c) because x′ > u and y′ > v by construction.

POWERS OF 3 WITH FEW NONZERO BITS 9

To check condition (a), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem: It suffices to check that 3y′ ≡ c + 2x′

modulo M′, modulo 2u, and modulo 3v.
We have 2o2 ≡ 1 mod M′ and 3o3 ≡ 1 mod M′ by the definitions of o2 and o3, so 3y′ ≡ 3y mod M′

and 2x′ ≡ 2x mod M′, and we have 3y′ ≡ c + 2x′ mod M′.
We have 2x′ ≡ 0 mod 2u because x + ro2 > u by construction. Since 3y′ ≡ 3y+so3 ≡ c mod 2u, we
have 3y′ ≡ c + 2x′ mod 2u.
The same reasoning shows that we have 3y′ ≡ 0 mod 3v, and since 2x′ ≡ 2x+ro2 ≡ −c mod 3v, we
have 3y′ ≡ c + 2x′ mod 3v. This shows that condition (a) holds for this x′ and y′, and completes the
proof of the lemma. □

Lemma 3.2.

(1) Let z be an integer with z ≡ 1 mod 8. For every integer u ≥ 3 there is an integer e0 such that the
integers e that satisfy 3e ≡ z mod 2u are precisely the integers e that satisfy e ≡ e0 mod 2u−2.
If x ≤ u is an integer with z ≡ 1 mod 2x, then e0 is divisible by 2x−2.
(2) Let z be an integer with z ≡ 1 mod 3. For every integer v ≥ 1 there is an integer e0 such that the
integers e that satisfy 2e ≡ z mod 3v are precisely the integers e that satisfy e ≡ e0 mod 2 · 3v−1.
If y ≤ v is an integer with z ≡ 1 mod 3y, then e0 is divisible by 2 · 3y−1.

Proof. For statement 1: We leave the reader to show that for every u ≥ 3, the order of 3 modulo 2u

is 2u−2. (The proof can be modeled after the proof of [3, Theorem 10.11, p. 218].) Since there are 2u−1

units in Z/2uZ, and the order of 3 is half of this, it follows that half of the units are powers of 3. A
power of 3 is never congruent to 5 or 7 modulo 8, and this accounts for half of the units. Therefore,
every unit that is 1 or 3 modulo 8 is a power of 3. Thus, there is an e0 such that 3e0 ≡ z. The fact that
3e ≡ z mod 2u if and only if e ≡ e0 mod 2u−2 is simply a consequence of the fact that the order of 3
modulo 2u is 2u−2.
If z ≡ 1 mod 2x with x ≤ u, then 3e0 ≡ 1 mod 2x, so e0 is a multiple of the order of 3 modulo 2x,
and hence e0 is divisible by 2x−2.
The proof of statement 2 is analogous, and we leave it to the reader. □

When we look at cases of equation (1) with larger values of n, we will find that Lemma 3.1 tells us
that we will need to include information gleaned from moduli divisible by primes p such that the order
of 3 modulo p is divisible by quite large powers of 2. In Section 5 we show how we can work our way
up to such moduli.
 4. Lifting solutions

Our proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 are computational. In each proof, we consider a sequence of
moduli M1, M2, . . ., each dividing the next. Roughly speaking, we first compute the solutions to
equation (1) or (2) modulo M1; then for each i > 1 in turn we “lift” the solutions modulo Mi−1 to
solutions modulo Mi. We stop when we have reached an Mi where all of the summands that appear on
the right-hand side of the solutions modulo Mi are determinate (in the sense defined in Section 2); at
that point, each solution modulo Mi can be lifted uniquely to a solution in the integers, if it lifts to a
solution at all.
 POWERS OF 3 WITH FEW NONZERO BITS 10

This strategy depends on our having efficient methods for lifting a solution modulo Mi−1 to a
solution modulo Mi. In Section 5 we will spell out our methods more formally, but in this section we
would like to give two examples to help make the methods more clear. For the sake of exposition,
we will focus on finding solutions to equation (1) modulo M for various M, and as we did in the
introduction, we will ignore the requirement that the summands be distinct.
As an example of one extreme case of the lifting problem, let M1 = 439 and let n = 12 and consider
the following solution to equation (1) modulo M1:

(7) 3
57 ≡ 2
0 + 21 + 211 + 212 + 215 + 216 + 226 + 227 + 237 + 257 + 2
65 + 268.

Let p be the prime 9361973132609 and let M2 = pM1. We will try to find a lift of the solution (7) to a
solution modulo M2. We compute that the graph of the powers of 2 modulo M1 forms a loop of cycle
length 73 with no tail... and we compute that the graph of powers of 2 modulo M2 is also a tailless
loop of cycle length 73. That means that there is exactly one power of 2 in Z/M2Z that reduces to a
given power of 2 in Z/M1Z. If we can lift equation (7) to a solution modulo M2, then the right-hand
side of the lifted solution will have to be

20 + 21 + 211 + 212 + 215 + 216 + 226 + 227 + 237 + 257 + 265 + 268 mod M2.

If we let z be this sum, then to determine whether there is a lift of equation (7) to a solution modulo M2,
we simply have to determine whether there is an x such that 3x ≡ z mod M2.
It turns out that the graph of powers of 3 modulo M2 is a tailless loop with cycle length p − 1 =
9361973132608, so we definitely do not want to find x (if it exists) by enumeration. Instead, we can
find x by using discrete logarithms.
If there is an x with 3x ≡ z mod M2, then that same x satisfies 3x ≡ z mod p for the prime p = M2/M1.
We can find an x that satisfies this congruence if and only if z ∈ (Z/pZ)∗ lies in the subgroup of (Z/pZ)∗

generated by 3. Using the computer algebra package Magma, we find that in fact 3 generates the whole
group of units, and Magma very quickly computes a discrete logarithm of z with respect to 3 — that is,
an integer x with 3x ≡ z mod p. In fact, every integer x satisfying

(8) x ≡ 3976447101915 mod (p − 1)

will give a solution to this congruence.
In order for x to give a solution modulo M2, we also need to have 3x ≡ z mod M1. The graph of
powers of 3 modulo M1 is a tailless loop with cycle length 146, and we find that for x to solve this
congruence modulo M1 we need to have x ≡ 57 mod 146.
But 146 is a divisor of p − 1, and reducing equation (8) modulo 146, we find that it becomes
x ≡ 31 mod 146. This is incompatible with the congruence from the preceding paragraph, so there is
no x with 3x ≡ z mod M2. This shows that equation (7) cannot be lifted to a solution modulo M2.
Let us turn to another example, which demonstrates a different approach to the lifting problem. We
again take M1 = 439 and start with the solution to equation (1) modulo M1 given by (7). This time,
however, we take p = 1753 and M2 = pM1. We will try to find a lift of the solution (7) to a solution
modulo M2.
The graph of powers of 2 modulo M2 is a tailless loop of cycle length 146, which is exactly twice
as long as the cycle of powers of 2 modulo M1. That means that there are exactly two powers of 2

POWERS OF 3 WITH FEW NONZERO BITS 11

modulo M2 that reduce to a given power of 2 modulo M1. In particular, the two lifts to Z/M2Z of the
element 2i ∈ Z/M1Z are 2i and 2i+73.
Similarly, we can also compute that there are six lifts of 357 ∈ Z/M1Z to powers of 3 in Z/M2Z,
namely 357, 3203, 3349, 3495, 3641, and 3787.
We see that every summand on the right-hand side of (7) has two lifts to Z/M2Z, and the left-hand
side has six lifts. In principle, we could compute all 6 · 212 = 24,576 lifts of the terms appearing
in (7) and check to see which combinations of lifts give us an equality modulo M2, but this would be
inefficient... and for larger values of n, it would become more and more inefficient.
Instead, we use a “meet in the middle” technique. We rewrite equation (7) to get the following
congruence modulo M1:

(9) 3
57 − 20 − 21 − 211 − 212 − 215 ≡ 216 + 226 + 227 + 237 + 257 + 2
65 + 268.

There are 6 · 25 = 192 lifts to Z/M2Z of the terms appearing on the left-hand side of (9), and 27 = 128
lifts of the terms on the right-hand side. We compute the values (modulo M2) of all of the left-hand
lifts, and the values of all of the right-hand lifts, and then compare the two lists to see whether there are
any values in common. (We can quickly find these common values if we sort each list first.) Each such
common value w gives us one (or more) lifts to Z/M2Z of (9), and hence also of (7). And clearly, all
solutions to (1) modulo M2 that are lifts of (7) will arise in this way. In point of fact, for this particular
example we found eight values of w, from which we obtained eight solutions to (1) in Z/M2Z that
were lifts of (7).
The two techniques we have demonstrated here for lifting solutions of (1) modulo M1 to solutions
modulo M2 are the basis for the procedure for proving Theorem 1.1 that we sketch in the following
section.
 5. Proof of Theorem 1.1

To prove Theorem 1.1 we consider the sequence of moduli Mi, where Mi = ∏ j≤i m j for the factors
m1, . . . , m64 listed in Table 5, so that each Mi divides the next. As we explained in Section 4, roughly
speaking we first compute the solutions to equation (1) in Z/M1Z; then, using the ideas sketched out
in the examples in Section 4, we lift the solutions to Z/M2Z, then to Z/M3Z, then to Z/M4Z, and so
on, stopping when we have reached an Mi where all of the powers of 2 that appear in the solutions are
determinate. If all the powers of 2 in a solution are determinate, the solution can be lifted uniquely to a
solution in the integers, if it lifts to a solution at all.
To be more precise: For a given i, we write Mi = 2ui3viM′
i where M′
i is coprime to 6. As we noted in
Section 2, there are ui + O2(Mi) distinct powers of 2 modulo Mi, and vi + O3(Mi) distinct powers of 3.
For each Mi in turn, we set M = Mi and compute the solutions (x, a1, . . . , an) to

with the added condition that for every pair ( j, k) of indices with j ̸= k, if a j and ak are both less than
ui, then a j ̸= ak. This last condition reflects the fact that if a < ui, then 2a is a determinate power of 2

in Z/M1Z, and the right-hand side exponents in the solutions to equation (1) are required to be distinct.
(Note that the upper bounds given in (10) have the effect of keeping us in line with Convention 2.1.)
For M1 = 24 · 7 · 73 we compute the solutions to (10) by brute force. The powers of 2 in Z/M1Z are
20 through 212. To every n-tuple (a1, . . . , an) of exponents between 0 and 12 with 0 = a1 ≤ · · · ≤ an,
we can associate the 13-tuple (b0, . . . , b12), where bi is the number of a j that are equal to i. Then
instead of enumerating all of the n-tuples (a1, . . . , an), we can simply run through all of the 13-tuples
(b0, . . . , b12) of non-negative integers such that

b0 + · · · + b12 = n

and b0 = 1, b1 ≤ 1, b2 ≤ 1, and b3 ≤ 1.

When we find such a 13-tuple with the additional property that ∑ b j2 j is congruent to 3x modulo M1
for one of the 12 powers of 3 modulo M1, we can compute the associated n-tuple (a1, . . . , an) and add
(x, a1, . . . , an) to our list of solutions of equation (10) with M = M1. We obtain all solutions to the
equation in this way.
Now suppose we have a list of solutions to (10) with M = Mi−1, and we want to create the list of
solutions with M = Mi, where Mi = miMi−1. Write Mi = 2ui3viM′
i with M′
i coprime to 6. For each
solution (x, a1, . . . , an) to the problem modulo Mi−1, we go through the following steps.

Step One: Compute the powers of 2 in Z/MiZ that lift the 2a j ∈ Z/Mi−1Z.
For each j = 1, . . . , n, we compute a list A j of the values of a′ with 0 ≤ a′ < ui + O2(Mi) such that
2a′ ≡ 2a j mod Mi−1.

Step Two: Compute the number of powers of 3 in Z/MiZ that lift 3x ∈ Z/Mi−1Z.
Let χ denote the number of values of x′ with 0 ≤ x′ < vi + O3(Mi) such that 3x′ ≡ 3x mod Mi−1.
If 3x is a determinate power of 3 modulo Mi−1, then χ = 1. If 3x is an indeterminate power of 3
modulo Mi, then χ = O3(Mi)/O3(Mi−1). And if 3x is indeterminate modulo Mi−1 but determinate
modulo Mi, then χ = 1 + O3(Mi)/O3(Mi−1).

Step Three: Compute the lifted solutions.
We compute lifted solutions in one of two ways; to decide between the two methods, we check
to see whether χ > ∏
n
j=1 #A j and whether mi is a prime that does not divide 6Mi−1. If both these
conditions hold, we say we are in the unbalanced case, and if not we say we are in the balanced case.

(1) The unbalanced case. In this case we must have χ > 1, so 3x is an indeterminate power of 3
modulo Mi−1; also, in this case we have vi = vi−1 because mi ̸= 3. We proceed as follows, for
each n-tuple (a′
1, . . . , a′
n) in A1 × · · · × An:
(a) Compute the right-hand side sum. Set s := ∑ j 2a′
j .
(b) Check to see whether the right-hand side sum is a power of 3 modulo Mi. To check to see
whether there is a power of 3, say 3x′, with 3x′ ≡ s mod Mi, we use discrete logarithms as
follows.
Let g be a generator of the group of units of Z/miZ, let z be the smallest non-negative
integer with gz ≡ s mod mi, and let y be the smallest positive integer with gy ≡ 3 mod mi,

POWERS OF 3 WITH FEW NONZERO BITS 14

so that z and y are discrete logarithms of s and of 3 with respect to the base g. If
there is an x′ such that 3x′ ≡ s mod Mi, then for this x′ we have 3x′ ≡ s mod mi, so we
must have x′y ≡ z mod (p − 1); for this x′ we have 3x′ ≡ s mod 2vi−1Mi−1, so we must
have x′ ≡ x mod O3(Mi−1); and for this x′ we have 3x′ ≡ 3x ≡ 0 mod 3vi, so we must
have x′ ≥ vi. Conversely, any x′ that satisfies these three conditions will also satisfy
3x′ ≡ s mod Mi.
For primes mi of the size we are considering, the computation of the discrete loga-
rithms z and y is easily done by the computer algebra package Magma, in which we have
written our code. It is also a straightforward matter to compute the values of x′ that meet
the three conditions, if any exist.
For each x′ that we find, we add (x′, a′
1, . . . , a′
n) to our list of solutions of equation (10)
with M = Mi.
The time required to carry out this step is proportional to the number of n-tuples (a′
1, . . . , a′
n)
that we have to consider, which is ∏ #Ai.
(2) The balanced case. We proceed as follows.
(a) Compute the left-hand side lifts. We compute the set X of the values of x′ with 0 ≤ x′ <
vi + O3(Mi) such that 3x′ ≡ 3x mod Mi−1.
(b) Group the variables into two balanced sets. Compute the value of k so that the product
#X · ∏ j≤k #A j and the product ∏ j>k #A j are as close in size as possible.
(c) Compute the lifts of the variables in each grouping. We make two lists. The first is the list
of all (k + 2)-tuples
 (3x′ − 2a′
1 − · · · − 2a′
k, x′, a′
1, . . . , a′
k)

for all (x′, a′
1, . . . , a′
k) ∈ X × A1 × · · · × Ak, where we view the first entry of the tuple as an
element of Z/MiZ. The second is the list of all (n − k + 1)-tuples

(2a′
k+1 + · · · + 2a′
n, a′
k+1, . . . , a′
n)

for all (a′
k+1, . . . , a′
n) ∈ Ak+1 × · · · × An, where again we view the first entry as an element
of Z/MiZ.
(d) Compare the lists for matching values. Sort each of these lists according to the value
of the first entry of each tuple, and then compare the two sorted lists to find all pairs of
elements, one from the first list and one from the second, whose first entries are equal.
Every such pair gives us a solution to

3x′ ≡ 2a′
1 + · · · + 2a′
n in Z/MiZ

that reduces to our original solution in Z/Mi−1Z. Add each such solution to our list of
solutions of equation (10) with M = Mi.
The time it takes to carry out this step is proportional to the larger of #X · ∏ j≤k #A j and
∏ j>k #A j. If these two numbers are somewhat balanced, the time required for this step will be
roughly proportional to the square root of #X · ∏ j≤n #A j.
Once we have computed all of the solutions to equation (10) with M = Mi by this method, we check
to see whether all of the powers of 2 that occur anywhere on our list are determinate. If they are

TABLE 3. For each n, we list the value of i such that our procedure for solving
equation (1) iterated up to the modulus Mi from Table 5. We also give the wall-clock
time it took for the computation to complete on a 2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core
i7 with 16GB RAM running Magma V2.23-1 on Mac OS 11.2.3. For n ≥ 20 the
computation was split into parts that were run by separate processes; the time given is
the sum of the wall-clock times for each process.

not, then we increase i by 1 and iterate the procedure. If they are, then for each solution to (10) with
M = Mi, we can check to see whether the (unique) lifts of the terms in the right-hand side of (10) to
powers of 2 in Z add up to a power of 3. In this way, we hope to find all solutions to (1).

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We ran through the procedure described above for all values of n from 3 to 22.
For each n, the procedure did terminate before we ran out of values of Mi, so we successfully found
all solutions to equation (1) for n ≤ 22. We found that the binary representation of 3x has at most
twenty-two bits equal to 1 exactly when x ≤ 25. □

In Table 5, we give for each n the value of i for which the modulus Mi gave us all solutions to the
equation. We also give the total time for the computation. As mentioned earlier, the programs we used
to implement this computation were written in Magma and are available as supplementary material
attached to the ArXiv version of this paper [13], as well as on the second author’s web site.
The procedure we described in the proof of Theorem 1.1 suggests the properties we looked for when
choosing the factors mi out of which our moduli Mi are built. In the balanced case, we want the sets A j
to be as small as possible, since the work in the balanced case is roughly on the order of the square
root of the product #X · ∏ j≤n #A j. Of course, we’d like #X to be small as well, but since there are n
sets A j we concentrate first on them.
For a given solution (x, a1, . . . , an) to (10) with M = Mi−1, how large are the A j? The answer is
analogous to the computation of the value of χ given in Step Two of our procedure. Suppose we are
in the case where mi is odd. If 2a j is a determinate power of 2 modulo Mi−1, then #A j = 1. If 2a j is
indeterminate modulo Mi−1, then it is indeterminate modulo Mi as well because mi is odd, and we have

POWERS OF 3 WITH FEW NONZERO BITS 16

#A j = O2(Mi)/O2(Mi−1). If mi is coprime to Mi−1, which is the case for all of the values we chose,
then O2(Mi) is the least common multiple of O2(mi) and O2(Mi−1).
The ideal case would be for O2(mi) to be a divisor of O2(Mi−1), so that the ratio O2(Mi)/O2(Mi−1)
would be 1. The next-best case would be for O2(mi) to divide 2O2(Mi−1) but not O2(Mi−1), so that
O2(Mi)/O2(Mi−1) would be 2. We were able to stay in these two cases for every i with mi odd, except
for i = 54, where we have O2(Mi)/O2(Mi−1) = 3.
For those i for which O2(Mi)/O2(Mi−1) = 1, we can focus more on the unbalanced case. These
i give us the opportunity to build up the number of powers of 2 in O′
3(Mi). For example, for i = 13
we have O2(Mi)/O2(Mi−1) = 1, and with the value of mi that we chose, we increase the 2-part of the
order of 3 from 28 in O′
3(Mi−1) to 216 in O′
3(Mi).
We found our mi mostly by looking for primes p congruent to 1 modulo 2a3b for various values of a
and b, and computing the orders of 2 and 3 in (Z/pZ)∗.
We make one final note about our choice of the mi. We would also like the number of solutions we
have to consider at any given stage to be small. This becomes especially critical for the larger values of
n that we consider. Our choices for mi, especially for small i, reflect this. For example, we have chosen
m4 to be 241 · 433, which puts us in the balanced case with #A j = 2 for most j and with #X = 10. After
this m4, we have m5 = 17, m6 = 22, and m7 = 38737. For smaller values of n, it turns out that it would
be faster to take m4 = 433 (which gives us #X = 1), m5 = 17, m6 = 22, and then to add in a factor of
241 before moving on to m7 = 38737. According to the heuristic mentioned in Step Three, the time it
takes to process a solution in the balanced case is very roughly proportional to (#X · ∏ j≤n #A j)1/2, so
having #X equal to 1 instead of 10 should speed up this step by a factor of about √
10. But for large n,
this improved speed for i = 4 would be outweighed by the extra time it would take to process the large
number of solutions that would make it through to the next step. To simplify our exposition, we have
simply given one single sequence of mi to use for all n, optimized for large values of n, even though
different choices would have made the program run faster for smaller n.

6. Proof of Theorem 1.2

The proof of Theorem 1.2 is also computational, and is essentially the same as that of Theorem 1.1.
The sequence of moduli we use is given in Table 6, and the time it took to run our program for n up to
24 is given in Table 6. The only other comment we make here is that if n is odd and greater than 1,
then there are no solutions to equation (2), because no power of 2 (other than 1) can be written as the
sum of an odd number of powers of 3. □
