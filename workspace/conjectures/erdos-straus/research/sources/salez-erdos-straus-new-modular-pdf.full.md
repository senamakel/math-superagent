The Erdős-Straus conjecture
New modular equations
and checking up to N = 1017

Serge E. Salez

Abstract

In 1999 Allan Swett [5] checked (in 150 hours) the Erdős-Straus conjecture up to N = 10
14

with a sieve based on a single modular equation. After having proved the existence of a
"complete" set of seven modular equations (including three new ones), this paper oﬀers an
optimized sieve based on these equations. A program written in C++ (and given elsewhere)
allows then to make a checking whose running time, on a typical computer
1, range from few
minutes for N = 10
14 to about 16 hours for N = 10
17.

1 Basic formulas

A fraction is said to be k-Egyptian if it is the sum of at most k positive unit fractions (i.e with
numerator equal to 1). The Erdős-Straus conjecture claims that 4/n is a 3-Egyptian fraction for
any n > 1.

1.1 Reduction

Through the identities 1
t = 1
t + 1 + 1
t(t + 1)

2
2t − 1 = 1
t + 1
t(2t − 1)

it is equivalent (for n > 2) to require having exactly 3 diﬀerent unit fractions, what we shall do
thereafter.

On the other hand, the identities
 4
3t − 1 = 1
t + 1
3t − 1 + 1
t(3t − 1)

4
4t − 1 = 1
t + 1
t(4t − 1)

4
8t − 3 = 1
2t + 1
t(8t − 3) + 1
2t(8t − 3)

show that the conjecture is veriﬁed if n = −1 mod 3 or n = −1 mod 4 or n = −3 mod 8. More-
over, if 4/n is 3-Egyptian then 4/kn is too.

To conclude, it is then suﬃcient to prove that 4/p is 3-Egyptian, for any prime integer p such that
p = 1 mod 24.

1.2 Rosati’s formulas

The following proposition is due (according to Mordell2) to Rosati [3]. The proof needs only simple
calculations and has been given many a time. This one is nevertheless original and standardize
the notations.

We set A = Z. Let A+ be the set of strictly positive elements of Z. In this context, we call prime
element an odd prime integer.

Proposition 1 Let p a prime element. The fraction 4/p is 3-Egyptian if and only if there exists
four elements of A+ denoted by A, B, C, D such that

4ABCD = A + B + pC and (ABD, p) = 1 (1)

or 4ABCD = p(A + B) + C and (ABCD, p) = 1 (2)

Proof If we assume that 4/p is 3-Egyptian, then there exists 3 elements of A+ denoted by
X1, X2, X3 such that 4
p = 1
X1 + 1
X2 + 1
X3 (3)

The Xi are not all divisible by p for otherwise we would have

4 = 1
X1/p + 1
X2/p + 1
X3/p ⩽ 3

In view of (3) it follows that
 4X1X2X3 = p(X2X3 + X3X1 + X1X2)

which shows that p divides at least one of the Xi. Hence we may set xi = Xi/pi where

p1 = p2 = 1, p3 = p and (x1x2, p) = 1

or p1 = p2 = p, p3 = 1 and (x3, p) = 1

depending on p divides exactly one or two Xi.

Therefore, since p2p3 = p

4p1p x1x2x3 = p(p2p3x2x3 + p3p1x3x1 + p1p2x1x2)

and hence 4x1x2x3 = p3x2x3 + p3x3x1 + p2x1x2

We set D = (x1, x2, x3) and x

i = xi/D. Then

′
2, x
′
3), B = (x
′
3, x
′
1), C = (x
′
1, x
′
2)

Since (x
′
1, x
′
2, x

3) = 1 it follows that A, B, C are pairwise relatively prime. So, we may write

x
′
1 = BCt1, x
′
2 = CAt2, x
′
3 = ABt3

where ti ∈ A+ are pairwise relatively prime. We note that

(t1, A) = (t2, B) = (t3, C) = 1

2So, unlike most paper, we don’t attribute to Mordell what Mordell himself attribute to others mathematicians.
In his book [2], often quoted, the four pages given to this conjecture doesn’t introduce a personal work but report
brieﬂy some papers whose sources are scrupulously pointed out : hence, it is absolutely incorrect to speak of
"Mordell’s theorem" or of "Mordell’s formulas". On a diﬀerent scale, it should be better not to remake what was
done with Pell’s equation.

With these notations, we have

4D BC CA AB t1t2t3 = p3CA AB t2t3 + p3AB BC t3t1 + p2BC CA t1t2

and hence 4ABCDt1t2t3 = p3At2t3 + p3Bt3t1 + p2Ct1t2

It follows that t1 | p3At2t3 which reduce to t1 | p3 and hence t1 = 1 for (x1, p3) = 1. Similar
arguments lead to t2 = 1 and t3 = 1. Finally

4ABCD = p3A + p3B + p2C (4)

Conversely, if we assume that A, B, C, D verify (4), we divide by pABCD and then

4
p = 1
p1BCD + 1
p2ACD + 1
p3ABD

which shows that 4/p is 3-Egyptian
3. ■

We observe that if p is not prime, (4) is still suﬃcient but no more necessary.

1.3 Notations

Henceforth, we systematically make use of the notations of Proposition 1. We add also E ∈ A+
and F ∈ A+ as follow.

By (4) and since (C, p3) = 1, we have C | A + B. If we write E = (A + B)/C then E ∈ A+ and
(4) is equivalent to {4ABD = p3E + p2
A + B = CE (5)

The relation (4) may be rewritten (4BCD − p3)A = p3B + p2C. We set F = 4BCD − p3 and then
(4) is equivalent to {F A = p3B + p2C2
F + p3 = 4BCD (6)

The second equation of (6) shows that F ∈ A, the ﬁrst one that F ∈ A+.

Moreover, by (5) we have 4(CE − B)BD = p3E + p2 and then (4BCD − p3)E = 4B2D + p2.
Whence F E = 4B2D + p2 (7)

2 Generalization

2.1 Deﬁnitions

Like for the integers, we say that a rational fraction is k-Egyptian if it is the sum of at most k
inverses of polynomials of Z[X].

We set A = Z[X]. Let A+ be the set of polynomials of Z[X] whose leading coeﬃcient is strictly
positive. In this context, we call prime element an irreducible polynomial of A+.

In the ring A, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is true and the GCD is unique if we request
it has to be in A+. Hence, the Proposition 1 holds also in this new context, without any change
neither in the text nor in the proof. It is the same for E and F as well as the related equations.

3For all purpose, we may write x = T /A, y = T /B, z = T /C where T = ABCD.

2.2 First application

Proposition 2 (Schinzel’s Theorem )
Let a > 0 and b such as (a, b) = 1. If 4/(at + b) is 3-Egyptian4 then b is a quadratic non residue
modulo a.

Proof We write p(t) = at+b. There exists τ such as the polynomials p, A, B, C, D, E take strictly
positive values for t > τ .

Depending on the case, the equation 4(B − CE)BD = p3E + p2 may be written

4(CE − B)BD = E + p or 4(CE − B)BD = pE + 1

So we have
 p = (4BCD − 1)E − 4B2D or pE2 = (4BCDE − 1)E − 4B2DE

and then, if we write D′ = DE

p = −4B2D mod 4BCD − 1 or pE2 = −4B2D′ mod 4BCD′ − 1

If b is a quadratic residue modulo a, there exists an integer k > τ such that ak + b is a square. If
t = k, it follows from propriety of the Jacobi symbol
5

( p
4BCD − 1
 ) = ( −4B2D
4BCD − 1
 ) = −1

which contradicts the fact that p is a square. Idem with pE2.

More precisely, if we write D = 2αm where m is odd, we obtain
( −4B2D
4BCD − 1
 ) = − ( D
4BCD − 1
 ) = − ( 2
4BCD − 1
 )α ( m
4BCD − 1
 )

If α > 0 then 4ABCD − 1 = 7 mod 8 and this implies
( 2
4BCD − 1
 ) = 1

For the second factor, using the law of quadratic reciprocity, we have
( m
4BCD − 1
 ) = (−1)
(m−1)/2 ( 4BCD − 1
m
 ) = (−1)
(m−1)/2 ( −1
m
 )

and then ( m
4BCD − 1
 ) = (−1)
(m−1)/2(−1)
(m−1)/2 = 1

2.3 Modular equations

For greater convenience, we call modular equation a modular equation (or a system of modular
equations) with constant coeﬃcients.

Since A and B play symmetrical roles, we may suppose6 that d ◦B ⩽ d ◦A, where d ◦ is the degree
of a polynomial.

Lemma 1 Let p be a prime polynomial of degree 1.

4at + b is supposed to be a polynomial (abuse of notation).
5The same notations p, A, B, C, D, E are still used for the values at t = k of these polynomials. By the way, a
similar calculation using the Kronecker symbol is made in the paper of Yamamoto[6].
6The arbitrary deﬁnition of F (A is factored out rather than B) was made in anticipation of this relation.
Otherwise we could not have d ◦F = 0.

i) If the relation (1) 4ABCD = A + B + pC holds, then

d ◦A = 1 d ◦B = 0 d ◦C = 0 d ◦D = 0 (8a)

d ◦A = 0 d ◦B = 0 d ◦C = 0 d ◦D = 1 (8b)
d ◦A = 1 d ◦B = 0 d ◦C = 1 d ◦D = 0 (8c)

ii) If the relation (2) 4ABCD = p(A + B) + C holds, then

d ◦A = 0 d ◦B = 0 d ◦C = 0 d ◦D = 1 (9a)
d ◦A = 1 d ◦B = 0 d ◦C = 0 d ◦D = 1 (9b)

d ◦A = 1 d ◦B = 0 d ◦C = 1 d ◦D = 0 (9c)
d ◦A = 2 d ◦B = 1 d ◦C = 0 d ◦D = 0 (9d)

Proof Since d ◦B ⩽ d ◦A then d ◦(A + B) = d ◦A. Hence, by C E = A + B, we have d ◦C ⩽ d ◦A

i) By (1) it follows (4ABD − p)C = A + B (10)

and (4BCD − 1)A = B + Cp (11)

By (10) we have d ◦(4ABD − p) ⩽ d ◦A and hence d ◦(4ABD − p) ⩽ d ◦ABD.

* Case d ◦(4ABD − p) = d ◦ABD
By (10) we have d ◦ABD + d ◦C = d ◦A

and then d ◦B + d ◦C + d ◦D = 0

This result implies, in view of (11), that
 d ◦A = d ◦p = 1

* Case d ◦(4ABD − p) < d ◦ABD. In this case

d ◦ABD = d ◦p = 1 and d ◦(4ABD − p) = 0

We have, by the ﬁrst equation
 d ◦B = 0 and d ◦A + d ◦D = 1

and by the second together with (10) d ◦C = d ◦A

ii) By (2) it follows (4ABD − 1)C = p(A + B) (12)

and (4BCD − p)A = pB + C (13)

By (12) we have d ◦ABD + d ◦C = d ◦A + d ◦p

and then d ◦B + d ◦C + d ◦D = 1

Here F = 4BCD − p. Then
 d ◦F ⩽ 1 and d ◦(pB + C) = d ◦pB

and together with (13) d ◦F + d ◦A = d ◦B + 1

* Case d ◦F = 1. In this case d ◦A = d ◦B. On the other hand, as d ◦F = 1, there exists t0 ∈ R
such that F (t0) = 0. From F E = 4B2D + 1, it follows 4B2(t0)D(t0) + 1 = 0 and then D(t0) < 0.
Therefore d ◦D = 1 and d ◦B = d ◦C = 0.

* Case d ◦F = 0. In this case d ◦A = d ◦B + 1. ■

Proposition 3 Let p be a prime polynomial of degree 1. The fraction 4/p is 3-Egyptian if and
only if one of the next 7 modular equations holds.

B + pC = 0 mod 4BCD − 1 (14a)

p + E = 0 mod 4AB and A + B = 0 mod E (14b)

p + E + 4B2D = 0 mod 4BDE (14c)

pE + 1 = 0 mod 4AB and A + B = 0 mod E (15a)

p + F = 0 mod 4BC and pB + C = 0 mod F (15b)

p + F = 0 mod 4BD and 4B2D + 1 = 0 mod F (15c)

p + F = 0 mod 4CD and p2 + 4C2D = 0 mod F (15d)

where (A, B) = (B, C) = (C, D) = (4ABD, E) = (4BCD, F ) = 1.

Proof The [ ] refer to the equations of the Lemma.

(14) Here "(4) is equivalent to (5)" is written

4ABCD = A + B + pC ⇐⇒ (p + E = 4ABD and A + B = CE)

(14a) Case [8a] : B, C, D are constants. If we suppose that (4) holds, then

B + pC = (4BCD − 1)A = 0 mod (4BCD − 1)

Conversely, we set
 A = B + pC
4BCD − 1

(14b) Case [8b] : A, B, E are constants. If we suppose that (4) holds, then

p + E = 4ABD = 0 mod 4AB and A + B = CE = 0 mod E

Conversely, we set
 D = p + E
4AB and C = A + B
E

(14c) Case [8c] : B, D, E are constants. If we suppose that (4) holds, then

p + E = 4(CE − B)BD

Hence p + E + 4B2D = 4BDEC = 0 mod 4BDE

Conversely, we set

A = p + E
4BD and C = p + E + 4B2D
4BDE (CE = A + B)

(15) Here "(4) is equivalent to (5)" is written

4ABCD = p(A + B) + C ⇐⇒ (4ABD = pE + 1 and A + B = CE)

and "(4) is equivalent to (6)" is written

4ABCD = p(A + B) + C ⇐⇒ (p + F = 4BCD and pB + C = F A)

where F = 4BCD − p and F E = 4B2D + 1

(15a) Case [9a] : A, B, E are constants. If we suppose that (4) holds, then

pE + 1 = 4ABD = 0 mod 4AB and A + B = CE = 0 mod E

Conversely, we set
 D = pE + 1
4AB and C = A + B
E

6

In the next cases d ◦A = d ◦B + 1 and then d ◦F = 0.

(15b) Case [9b] : B, C, F are constants. If we suppose that (4) holds, then

p + F = 4BCD = 0 mod 4BC and pB + C = F A = 0 mod F

Conversely, we set
 D = p + F
4BC and A = pB + C
F

(15c) Case [9c] : B, D, F are constants. If we suppose that (4) holds, then

p + F = 4BCD = 0 mod 4BD and 4B2D + 1 = EF = 0 mod F

Conversely, we set
 C = p + F
4BD E = 4B2D + 1
F and A = CE − B

We observe that F A = pB + C.

(15d) Case [9d] : C, D, F are constants. If we suppose that (4) holds, then

p + F = 4BCD = 0 mod 4CD and pB + C = F A = 0 mod F

As
 pB + C = p p + F
4CD + C = p2 + pF + 4C2D
4CD
it follows, since (4CD, F ) = 1,
 p2 + 4C2D = 0 mod F

Conversely, we set
 B = p + F
4CD and A = pB + C
F ■

We observe that, if p is a prime polynomial of degree 1, the Lemme1 shows that there are only 7
distinct cases, according to the degree of A, B, C, D (d ◦B ⩽ d ◦A). By the Proposition 3, each
case is connected to a modular equation. Hence, there exist only 7 distinct modular equations with
constant coeﬃcients. So, we can build an algorithm giving the set (maybe empty) of all the way
to write 4/p.

2.4 Application to the integers

The proof of the Proposition 3 gives us formulas for A, B, C, D. These variables take strictly
positive values when the given data are strictly positive and one of the equation (1) or (2) holds.
Hence we have the following corollary.

Corollary 1 Let p be an odd prime integer. The fraction 4/p is 3-Egyptian if and only if one of
the 7 modular equations of the Proposition 3 holds.

Thereafter, we call these equations reference equations not only for the polynomials but for the
integers too.

Comparison with previous results

Four of these equations have been well known for a long time, but the others are new.

• Rosati [3] (1954) gives only one condition for (1) and one for (2). Although they are not
written in a modular form, his equations (3) and (6) are equivalent to (14a) and (15a).

• Yamamoto [6] (1965) gives two conditions for (1) and two for (2). Written in a modular form,
his equations (3) to (6) are equivalent (not in the same order) to (14a), (14b), (15a), (15b).

Polynomials explain why the Yamamoto equivalent equations give distinct results. Even better,
they give us three new equations.
 7

"Complete" set of modular equations

Regarding prime polynomials of degree 1, the 7 reference equations form a complete set
7, that is,
if a modular equation n = b mod a (where (a, b) = 1) is not equivalent to one of the reference
equations then 4/(at+b) cannot be an 3-Egyptian fraction. This feature does not hold for integers :
it may exist a process using such an equation and leading to the conclusion that 4/n is a 3-Egyptian
fraction. But, in this case, this process has to be of a still unknown new type.

2.5 Examples

Example 0. Of course, we may ﬁnd the identities of paragraph 1.1. Here, we don’t look after all
the way to write 4/p, just those given in the paragraph.

• p = 3t − 1 veriﬁes (14a) : p + 1 = 0 mod 3
where B = C = D = 1, and hence A = (p + 1)/3 = t.

• p = 4t − 1 veriﬁes (14b) : p + 1 = 0 mod 4
where A = B = E = 1 and hence C = 2 et D = (p + 1)/4 = t.

• p = 8t − 3 veriﬁes (14b) : p + 3 = 0 mod 8
where A = 1, B = 2, E = 3 and hence C = 1, D = (p + 3)/8 = t.

Example 1. p = 24 · 5t − 23 (p = 1 mod 24 and p = 2 mod 5)
We give all the way to write 4/p and the distinctive feature is that the 7 reference equations (shown
in [ ]) are present. We don’t know another analogous example where p = 1 mod 24.

Example 2. In this example, each p is of the form p = 24 · 583t + b. At the opposite of the
example 1, the distinctive feature is that, for some b, there is only one way to write 4/p. A value
of b is given for each reference equation.

3 Modular sieve

The algorithms setting, for a given integer n > 2, at least one way (and even more) to write 4/n
are interesting. However, regarding the checking of the conjecture, an eﬃcient algorithm needs an
another point of view8.

We denote by N0 the set of the integers n ∈ N verifying the condition n = 1 mod 24. The
process described below takes account speciﬁcally of the fact that the checked integers are in N0.
On the other hand, we let down the condition that n is prime, which needs too much running
time. Regarding the polynomial at + b, the correlated conditions are at + b = 1 mod 24 (which is
equivalent to a = 0 mod 24 and b = 1 mod 24) and the cancellation of the condition (a, b) = 1.

3.1 Modular ﬁlters

Deﬁnition : A sieve is a sorted set of ﬁlters.

Deﬁnition : A ﬁlter 9modulo m is a set F such that for any n ∈ N0

n%m ∈ F ⇒ 4/n is 3-Egyptian

where n%m is the residue of n modulo m (notation borrowed from C language).

For a > 0, we denote by Ωa the set of b ∈ Z such that 4/(at + b) is a 3-Egyptian fraction. If m is
odd, we set Sm = (
Ω[m,24] ∩ N0) %m where [u, v] = LCM(u, v). It follows some obvious proprieties.

8This point of view has been used since Rosati’s paper (or maybe before).
9We use the terminology given by Swett. If an integer n ∈ N0 is such that n%m ∈ F then n veriﬁes the conjecture
and n is "trapped" by the ﬁlter. Otherwise n "pass through".

i) if q | a then Ωq ⊂ Ωa.

ii) if b1 = b2 mod a then b1 ∈ Ωa ⇒ b2 ∈ Ωa.

iii) if n ∈ Ωa (n > 0) then 4/n is a 3-Egyptian fraction.

iv) if n ∈ N0 then (
n ∈ Ω[m,24] ⇐⇒ n%m ∈ Sm)
, which shows that Sm is a ﬁlter modulo m.

v) if n ∈ N0 and if q | m then n%q ∈ Sq ⇒ n%m ∈ Sm.

Déﬁnition : We say that n ∈ N0 is certiﬁed if there exists m such that n%m ∈ Sm. We also say
that n is certiﬁed by m or that m is a modular certiﬁcate of n (vocabulary borrowed from the
complexity theory).

3.2 Shortened ﬁlters

If m is composite, some integers n ∈ N0 are certiﬁed both par m and by one of its divisors (cf. the
propriety v) above). The next deﬁnition allows us to point out what is particular to m.

Deﬁnition : The shortened ﬁlter S∗
m is the set of all x ∈ Sm such that

x%q /∈ Sq for any q | m, q ̸= m

We observe that if m is prime then S∗
m = Sm.

4 Checking of the conjecture

4.1 Choice of the progressions

The checked integers n are in an arithmetic progression, namely they are of the form n = 24k + 1.
We call gap of the progression the diﬀerence between two consecutive terms. Here the gap is
G0 = 24 but if we use some ﬁlters Sm we may obtain other progressions whose gap is bigger.

10

With S5 = {0, 2, 3} we check only n such that

n%24 = 1 and n%5 ∈ {1, 4}

and hence, by the Chinese remainder theorem

n%120 ∈ {1, 49}

The new gap is G1 = 120, and there are 2 residues : then the mean gap is g1 = 60. In comparison
to 24, we check 2.5 times fewer integers (60/24 = 2.5).

Next, with S7 = {0, 3, 5, 6} we check only n such that

n%120 ∈ {1, 49} and n%7 ∈ {1, 2, 4}

and hence n%840 ∈ R2

where R2 = {1, 121, 169, 289, 361, 529} is the set of the residues10. The new gap is G2 = 840 and the
mean gap is g2 = 140. In comparison to 24, we check nearly 6 times fewer integers (140/24 = 35/6).

We may keep on and use others Sm. The checked integers are then of the form

n%Gi ∈ Ri

where the ﬁrst values of Gi = Gi−1mi and #Ri (the number of elements of Ri) are set out in the
following table.
 i mi Gi #Ri gi

1 5 120 2 60

2 7 840 6 140

3 11 9 240 34 272

4 13 120 120 192 626

5 17 2 042 040 1 507 1 355

6 19 38 798 760 13 380 2 900

7 23 892 371 480 147 348 6 056

Three comments about this table.

• The ﬁrst concerns the reduction of Ri (done in the table). If n = r mod Gi then for any
q divisor of Gi we have n%q = r%q. Hence, we may remove the residues r ∈ Ri verifying
r%q ∈ Sq. This reduction is essential, otherwise it’s just a useless complicated process.

• The second concerns the last column : the mean gap gi = Gi/#Ri is a good speed indicator.
By example, as 6 056/140 ≈ 43, then using G7 rather than G2 leads to check about 43 times
fewer integers and the running time is shortened accordingly.

• The last concerns the choice of the mi. The usual order is misleading : each other set of seven
integers seems to give a worse g7. Next, with height integers we expect to add 31 (rather
than 29). However, these two propositions have to be conﬁrmed.

4.2 Optimized sieve

We denote by Ni the set of all the integers n ∈ N verifying n%Gi ∈ Ri. As the conjecture is veriﬁed
for any integer n /∈ Ni, we have just to check the prime integers of Ni.

Let N = 1017 and M the set of all the odd integers m < 5 000. We claim that each n ∈ N7
has a modular certiﬁcate in M if n < N and if n is not a square. It is equivalent to say that

10It was the choice made by Swett.
 11

N7 \ ⋃
m∈M Ω[m,24] has not any element n < N , except squares.

We could use this M to prove that the conjecture is veriﬁed up to N . However, if we want a
running time as fewer as possible, we have to optimize the sieve. For this purpose, we remove the
useless elements and sort M in order to have at ﬁrst the most eﬃcient ﬁlters11. By example for
N = 1017, we give below the set M = M OD which is used in our C++ program.

M OD = { 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 4495, 2491, 2627, 4661, 4223, 1505, 4355, 3355, 4509, 4775,

4.3 Results

The checked integers are of the form n = r + k × G7 where r ∈ R7 and 0 ⩽ k < K. With
N = 1017, we take K = 112 066 560. Therefore we check 16 512 783 482 880 integers including
51 732 427 squares.

For each m ∈ M OD, the number of integers certiﬁed by m is given at the same rank in the table
below. We may observe that the sum of these numbers added with the number of squares is equal
to the number of checked integers.
