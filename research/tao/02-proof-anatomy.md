# The anatomy of a Tao proof

Eleven solved problems, dissected for the *sequence of moves* that produced the solution
rather than the mathematics of it. Fixed six-field schema per entry: **(a)** as posed;
**(b)** the reframing that unlocked it; **(c)** imported machinery and its source field;
**(d)** what was computed or verified; **(e)** program length and the ladder of prior
partial and no-go results; **(f)** the transferable move, as a firing rule with a trigger
and a safety check.

Three findings invert the folklore and should be read first:

1. **Polymath8 is the cautionary case.** Thirteen months of collaborative optimisation
   drove the prime gap from 70,000,000 to 4,680. Maynard then reached 600 independently
   while *discarding* the Zhang/Polymath8a machinery entirely, needing only classical
   Bombieri–Vinogradov. The winning branch was not the one the effort went into. An agent
   budgeting by "progress per unit effort on the current branch" would have starved it.
2. **Greenfeld–Tao's no-go results were navigational, not consolation.** Their 2021
   rigidity result proved a one-tile Wang encoding *cannot* work. That is what sent them
   to the Sudoku encoding that did. A no-go prunes the search space; score it as progress.
3. **Simplification is a research mode.** Sunflower: ALWZ (Aug 2019) → Rao's coding
   rewrite (Sep 2019) → Tao's entropy rewrite (Jul 2020) → Bell–Chueluecha–Warnke's better
   bound (Sep 2020), plus a sideways transplant carrying the *spread lemma* onto
   Kahn–Kalai. Rewriting someone else's proof produced the next bound.

**Provenance.** Entries 1–9 rest on sourced research (arXiv, terrytao.wordpress.com,
Quanta, Polymath wiki); URLs at the end. Entries 10–11 touch material at or past the
assistant's knowledge cutoff; unconfirmed claims there are marked **[UNVERIFIED]**.

## 1. Green–Tao: the primes contain arbitrarily long APs

**(a)** Descends from the Erdős–Turán program (1936, explicitly motivated by the primes).
Erdős's stronger divergent-reciprocals conjecture is still open. arXiv math/0404188
(8 Apr 2004); *Annals* 167 (2008) 481–547.

**(b)** The primes have density zero, so Szemerédi does not apply. Rather than attack
that, change the target to *finding a pseudorandom majorant*: prove a **relative**
Szemerédi theorem for any measure ν satisfying a linear forms condition and a correlation
condition, then place the primes inside a set of almost primes where their *relative*
density is positive (~1/k). Density zero becomes density 1/k by changing the ambient
measure, not the set.

**(c)** Szemerédi's theorem (1975) as a black box, from combinatorics; the Furstenberg
(1977) ergodic and Gowers (1998–2001) Fourier proofs shaped the uniformity-norm framework;
the Goldston–Yıldırım sieve from analytic number theory — imported from the *small prime
gaps* programme, a different problem.

**(d)** Nothing load-bearing. The theorem is existential and exhibits no AP; the AP-23
through AP-27 records are downstream and independent.

**(e)** ~68 years; Tao's own programme ~2. Ladder: van der Corput 1939 (3-term APs);
Heath-Brown 1981 (4-term with one almost-prime); Green 2005, *Roth's theorem in the
primes* — the k=3 case of the transference idea, one year ahead of the general result. Six
arXiv versions, four-year referee gap. Conlon–Fox–Zhao later removed the correlation
condition entirely.

**(f) MOVE — transfer through a majorant.** *Trigger:* the target set is too sparse for a
known theorem about dense sets. *Action:* do not attack sparsity; find a tractable superset
in which the target has positive relative density, and prove the known theorem relative to
that superset's measure. *Check:* the majorant must satisfy explicitly stated
pseudorandomness conditions, verifiable for the actual superset — the sieve estimate is the
real work, not the transference.

## 2. Erdős discrepancy problem

**(a)** Erdős, c. 1932: is there a ±1 sequence f and constant C with |Σ_{j≤k} f(jd)| ≤ C
for all d, k? $500 prize. Open ~83 years.

**(b)** Two hops. *Hop 1* (Polymath5, Jan 2010): a Fourier reduction from the general
hypothesis to a statement about **completely multiplicative** functions. *Hop 2* (Sep 2015):
route through the **Elliott conjecture**, used *as an inverse theorem* — a bad
multiplicative function is forced to correlate with a modulated Dirichlet character, then
killed by a variant of Borwein–Choi–Coons. That gave a *conditional* proof on 11 Sep 2015.
The unconditional step came a week later by **weakening the input**: a *logarithmically
averaged* Elliott conjecture, weaker than the one assumed, which the same argument accepts.
The Elliott route was suggested by a Polymath5 participant, Uwe Stroinski.

**(c)** Pretentious multiplicative number theory (Granville–Soundararajan);
Matomäki–Radziwiłł on multiplicative functions in short intervals — a tool that did not
exist during Polymath5; and from **information theory** the new **entropy decrement
argument**, built by explicit analogy with the density- and energy-increment arguments
around Szemerédi's theorem.

**(d)** Konev–Lisitsa (arXiv:1402.2184, Feb 2014) SAT-encoded C=2: a maximal sequence of
length **1160**, and none of length **1161**. The DRUP certificate was ~**13 GB**, larger
than Wikipedia at the time and not humanly checkable. Prior search reached only 1124. It
settled one value of C and nothing else.

**(e)** Polymath5 opened 19 Jan 2010 with the three-step programme already sketched, ran
through 2010, was revived Sep 2012, and **stalled**. SAT (2014) handled one C. The solve
ran 11 Sep → 18 Sep 2015; *Discrete Analysis* 2016:1, the journal's inaugural paper. Note
the shape: the collaborative phase produced the reduction the eventual solo proof used,
five years later, once an external tool existed.

**(f) MOVE — weaken the hypothesis, not the conclusion.** *Trigger:* a proof conditional on
conjecture X, with X out of reach. *Action:* audit which consequences of X the proof
actually consumes and prove only those — typically an averaged, logarithmic, or low-moment
version. *Check:* re-run the whole derivation against the weakened X; "the argument adapts
without difficulty" must be verified. *Corollary:* a stalled collaboration that produced a
reduction is not a failure — re-attempt it whenever a new external tool lands.

## 3. Almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values

**(a)** The 3x+1 map, Collatz c. 1937. Lagarias: "This is a really dangerous problem.
People become obsessed with it and it really is impossible."

**(b)** Three simultaneous, explicit changes. *All* → *almost all*. *Bounded* → *almost
bounded* (Col_min(N) < f(N) for **any** f → ∞, e.g. four-fold iterated log). And the
load-bearing one, *natural density* → **logarithmic density**. The reason is mechanical:
the uniform measure on [1,x] is not transported by Collatz dynamics to anything like the
uniform measure on [1,x^θ], so local results cannot be iterated; logarithmic density is
approximately invariant, so they can. The stated analogy is Bourgain's invariant-measure
method for nonlinear Schrödinger. The trigger was social — an anonymous blog commenter
suggested trying "almost all".

**(c)** PDE almost-sure local-to-global wellposedness and invariant measures (Bourgain);
**probability** — Syracuse random variables, total-variation stabilisation, renewal
processes, a 2D random walk avoiding triangles; **Fourier analysis** — a decay estimate
from an *averaged* Riesz product after conditioning, not a plain one; 3-adic analysis.

**(d)** Not central. Backdrop: Barina 2020 verified all N up to 2⁶⁸ on one GPU.

**(e)** ~82 years; Tao's arc 2011 → 2019. Ladder, every rung a *natural*-density statement
with a polynomial ceiling: Terras 1976; Everett 1977; Allouche 1979 (θ > 0.869); Korec 1994
(θ > 0.7924, the record for 25 years); Krasikov–Lagarias 2003. Tao's result is
incomparable, not a better exponent. **He wrote the no-go himself in 2011**: any proof of
full Collatz must use transcendence theory or create exponential separation between powers
of 2 and 3. The 2019 paper sidesteps its author's own barrier by not proving the conjecture.

**(f) MOVE — change the measure to one the dynamics preserves.** *Trigger:* a local result
that resists iteration into a global one. *Action:* check whether the failure is that your
measure is not approximately invariant under the map; if so, find one that is and restate
the theorem in it. *Check:* the new measure must keep the conclusion meaningful — saying
that logarithmic density is weaker is part of the result. *Companion rule:* when a barrier
blocks target T, enumerate the weakenings of T the barrier does not cover.

## 4. Finite-time blowup for an averaged 3D Navier–Stokes equation

**(a)** Global regularity for 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes; Clay Millennium Problem
(2000). Write ∂_t u = Δu + B(u,u), where ⟨B(u,u),u⟩ = 0 *is* the energy identity.
arXiv:1402.0290 (3 Feb 2014); *JAMS* 29 (2016) 601–674.

**(b)** Abandon the equation. Replace B by an **averaged** B̃ — over spatial rotations and
order-zero Fourier multipliers — chosen so ⟨B̃(u,u),u⟩ = 0 still holds, then construct a
smooth finite-time-blowup solution for B̃. Those operations are bounded on essentially all
relevant function spaces, so B̃ obeys almost every upper-bound estimate B does; any proof
phrased purely in such estimates plus energy would apply verbatim to B̃ and prove something
false. Tao: "it is not possible to establish global regularity by any 'abstract' approach
which only uses upper bound function space estimates on the nonlinear part of the equation,
combined with the energy identity." The output is a theorem about a *class of methods*.

**(c)** Dyadic shell ODE models from Katz–Pavlović. The conceptual import is **computer
architecture**: the blowup mechanism is "a von Neumann machine … that, after some time
delay, manages to suddenly create a replica of itself at a finer scale." Each copy is
(1+ε₀) times smaller and (1+ε₀)^{5/2} times faster; the geometric series converges. Tao's
speculation — enough "logic gates" made of ideal fluid would reduce the task "to a software
engineering exercise rather than a PDE problem."

**(d)** None.

**(e)** Seven years of deliberately building the barrier. 2007: *Why global regularity for
Navier–Stokes is hard* — the supercriticality diagnosis, with an explicit enumeration of
what any successful method must do. 2007: arXiv:0710.1604, quantitative formulation. 2009:
global regularity for a *logarithmically supercritical* hyperdissipative NSE — the
positive-direction probe measuring how far past criticality energy methods reach. 2014: the
barrier as a theorem. 2016: an Euler-type vorticity-form blowup, with honest caveats (Type
II not Type I; no Hamiltonian structure). Tao in 2014: "I don't expect this program to come
to fruition any time in the next five years." **Downstream:**
Cardona–Miranda–Peralta-Salas–Presas built Turing-complete stationary Euler flows on the
3-sphere (*PNAS* 2021) — via **contact geometry**, not PDE. The speculation seeded a
programme in another community.

**(f) MOVE — prove the barrier when you cannot prove the theorem.** *Trigger:* repeated
failures on T that share a characterisable feature ("uses only estimate class E plus
conserved quantity Q"). *Action:* construct a perturbed problem satisfying every property
in that characterisation but false, and prove it false. *Check:* the perturbation must
preserve *all* exploited properties — the barrier's value is exactly the size of the class
it kills. *Corollary:* a barrier is a positive result; log which future attempts it forbids.

## 5. Sendov's conjecture for sufficiently high degree

**(a)** Sendov, 1959 (long misattributed to Iliev): if a degree-n ≥ 2 complex polynomial
has all zeros in the closed unit disk, then each zero λ₀ has a zero of f′ within distance 1.
arXiv:2012.04125; *Acta Mathematica* 229 (2022) 347–392.

**(b)** Do not prove the conjecture; prove there is an absolute n₀ with the conjecture
holding for all n ≥ n₀. "All degrees" → "all large degrees" buys an asymptotic regime where
compactness applies. The price is paid openly: the proof is compactness-and-contradiction
(counterexamples with n → ∞, repeated subsequence extraction), hence **ineffective** — no
explicit n₀, and Tao says any quantitative substitute would give one "certainly much larger
than 9."

**(c)** **Probability and potential theory into complex analysis.** Zeros of f and f′ become
random variables; tools are logarithmic potentials, Stieltjes transforms, balayage, Grace's
theorem, unique continuation for harmonic functions, and the "cheap nonstandard analysis"
compactness formalism from PDE. The limiting identity has a Brownian reading: two Brownian
motions started at the two limit laws exit the disk with the same distribution.

**(d)** No numerics of consequence. Two regimes (zero near origin, zero near boundary) each
close by contradiction — an argument-principle winding number in one, incompatible
Fourier-mode conditions in the other.

**(e)** 61 years; Tao's programme ~1. The prior ladder is *degree-by-degree verification*,
which is the point: n < 6 (Meir–Sharma 1969), n < 7 (Brown 1991), n < 8 (Borcea 1996),
n < 9 (Brown–Xiang 1999) — thirty years for four degrees. Structural cases covered other
ranges (Gauss–Lucas at a=0; Bojanov 2011; Chalebgwa 2020; Kasmalkar 2014). Tao attacks the
same axis from the far end, leaving a finite but astronomical middle gap. **[UNVERIFIED]**
Wikipedia reportedly now records a claimed full proof (5 Aug 2026, Lech Mazur, with GPT-5.6
Pro assistance); an earlier claimed preprint (arXiv:2210.08720) also exists. Neither checked.

**(f) MOVE — attack the parameter axis from the opposite end.** *Trigger:* a conjecture
indexed by n whose verification proceeds 1, 2, 3, … and has stalled. *Action:* prove it for
all sufficiently large n instead, using compactness in the n → ∞ limit. *Check:* state the
ineffectivity plainly and do not claim the conjecture; the residual gap may be unclosable.
*Note:* this converts an infinite open problem into a finite computation — a change of kind.

## 6. Polynomial Freiman–Ruzsa (Marton's conjecture)

**(a)** Freiman (1960s) on small sumsets; **Katalin Marton** (d. 2019) formulated the
polynomial-bound variant, published for her by Ruzsa in 1999. Proved: if A ⊆ F₂ⁿ with
|A+A| ≤ K|A|, then A lies in at most 2K¹² cosets of a subspace H with |H| ≤ |A|.
Gowers–Green–Manners–Tao, arXiv:2311.05762 (9 Nov 2023); *Annals* 201 (2025).

**(b)** **Measure sets by entropy, not cardinality.** Work with random variables and the
entropic Ruzsa distance d(X;X) := H(X₁+X₂) − H(X). The engine is a *fibring inequality*:
for a homomorphism π, the doubling of the data is at least that of its image plus the
conditional doubling of the fibres — driving d down geometrically to an endgame where
characteristic-2 independence closes it. The entropy idea was **Gowers' from ~20 years
earlier**, resurrected June 2023. Tao: "At some point we realized that these old ideas from
Tim from 20 years ago were actually more likely to work than the ones we were trying."

**(c)** Information theory into additive combinatorics.

**(d)** The formalisation is the story. Launched **13 Nov 2023, four days after the
preprint**; complete **5 Dec 2023** — three weeks; **~25 volunteer contributors**, several
never met by the maintainers; **Tao wrote ~5% of the Lean**. Coordination ran on Patrick
Massot's **Blueprint**: a human-readable proof skeleton with a colour-coded dependency graph
(green = formalised, blue = ready) linked to the Lean, running within ~48 hours. Tao on why
it scales: "my fellow repository maintainers and I have already approved several pull
requests from contributors that had not previously met, as the code was verified to be
correct." Formal verification removes *trust* as a prerequisite for mass collaboration.
By-product: a Shannon entropy inequality library now upstreaming into Mathlib. Copilot's
inline suggestions were sometimes "almost correct"; Lean's own `exact?` was more effective.

**(e)** ~24 years from Marton's formulation; the mathematics took ~5 months. Prior bounds
were exponential; **Sanders 2012** gave a quasi-polynomial Bogolyubov–Ruzsa lemma, the
record until 2023 — and good enough to lower the field's urgency without resolving
anything. Sequels came fast: bounded-torsion groups (Apr 2024), Liao's exponent 11, then 9.

**(f) MOVE — replace the size functional with one that has a chain rule.** *Trigger:* an
induction on a combinatorial quantity that resists because the quantity does not decompose
along maps. *Action:* find an information-theoretic surrogate with a decomposition identity,
restate the conjecture in it, and induct there. *Check:* the surrogate must imply the
original — the translation back is a proof obligation. *Companion rule:* formalising a
finished proof is parallelisable at near-zero coordination cost, because the verifier
replaces peer trust. Budget three weeks and twenty strangers, not two years and a co-author.

## 7. Bounded gaps between primes: Zhang, Polymath8, Maynard

**(a)** Twin primes: liminf(p_{n+1} − p_n) = 2. The tractable target came from
Goldston–Pintz–Yıldırım (2005): any exponent of distribution θ > 1/2 in Bombieri–Vinogradov
gives bounded gaps. Granville on the near-miss: "We could have done this seven years ago if
we hadn't been so sure we couldn't do it!" **Zhang**, 13–14 May 2013, *Annals* 179 (2014):
gaps < 7×10⁷.

**(b)** Three successive reframings. *Zhang:* do not prove Elliott–Halberstam; prove a
weakened version restricted to **smooth squarefree moduli**, which suffices for GPY.
*Polymath8:* the argument is numerically parameterised in (ϖ, δ, k₀, H), so the result
becomes an **optimisation problem** — and, being modular, splits into six components worked
in parallel. *Maynard:* replace GPY's one-variable sieve weight with a **multi-variable**
one, scoring each number individually rather than the tuple collectively, converting the
problem into a calculus of variations over a simplex. Tao's own statement of the sting:
Maynard's arguments "avoid using the difficult partial results … established by Zhang and
then refined by Polymath8; instead, the main input is the classical Bombieri–Vinogradov
theorem."

**(c)** Zhang: Kloosterman sums, Weil/Deligne bounds, the Heath-Brown identity. Polymath8a:
ℓ-adic **trace functions** and the Graham–Ringrose method, brought in bodily by their
practitioners (Fouvry, Kowalski, Michel, Nelson) — algebraic geometry over finite fields
arriving as people, not citations. Polymath8b: **quadratic programming and Krylov
iteration** from numerical analysis.

**(d)** Two computational subprojects; here computation *is* the endgame. *Narrow admissible
tuples:* Zhang, Hensley–Richards, Schinzel and greedy sieves, iterated merging (~5% narrower
than previous constructions), plus local optimisations; Engelsma's private database was
opened to the project; Sutherland ran a public submission database auto-converting a new k
into a new H. *The variational problem:* M_k bracketed numerically (1.845 ≤ M₄ ≤ 1.848;
3.95608 ≤ M₅₉ ≤ 4.148), with M_k > 4 the threshold that matters. The final k=50 / H=246
record was a **two-week computation** by Pace Nielsen.

**(e)** ~13 months, 37 blog threads, 20–50 comments a day at peak, a wiki, a shared Dropbox.
Ladder: 70,000,000 (14 May 2013) → 59,874,594 → 13,008,612 → **8a launches 4 Jun** →
388,284 → 11,123 → 5,414 → **4,680 (27 Jul, 8a endpoint)** → **600 (19 Nov, Maynard,
independently)** → 576 → 330 → 270 → **246 (14 Apr 2014)**. Conditional: 12 under EH, 6
under GEH — and 6 is the sieve-method barrier, so the method's ceiling was reached *and
identified*. Tao on the pace: "Just ten minutes of effort … there was a chance to push the
bound down … and claim, however briefly, the 'world record'." Sutherland on the cost: "The
participants really have to be comfortable with making mistakes in a forum that is both
public and permanent." Kowalski: without the format, "we would never have dared to make
such a technical improvement public."

**(f) MOVE — parameterise, then optimise; but fund the orthogonal branch.** *Trigger:* a
proof whose conclusion is a number determined by several independent technical inputs.
*Action:* expose the parameters, split into modules with a published interface, let each
improve independently, and keep a live leaderboard so gains compose automatically.
*Check — the important one:* monotone improvement on a fixed architecture has a ceiling, and
a structurally different attack may leapfrog the whole ladder from a weaker start. Reserve
budget for the branch that is not currently winning.

## 8. The sunflower lemma, and simplification as a research mode

**(a)** A sunflower with r petals: sets A₁…A_r sharing a core A₀ with pairwise disjoint
petals. **Erdős–Rado**, 1960: any k!(r−1)^k + 1 sets of size k contain an r-sunflower;
conjectured C(r)^k suffices. Erdős offered **$1,000** for r = 3. Open 59 years.

**(b)** ALWZ (Alweiss–Lovett–Wu–Zhang, arXiv:1908.08483, 22 Aug 2019; *Annals* 194 (2021))
improved the bound to about (log w)^w, proving it for a *robust* notion of sunflower for
which it is sharp to lower-order terms. The shared engine is the **spread lemma**: a random
set **A** is R-spread if P(S ⊂ **A**) ≤ R^{−|S|} for all S. Then the cascade. **Rao** (Sep
2019) replaced ALWZ's probabilistic random-restriction argument with an explicit **Shannon
noiseless coding** construction. **Tao** (20 Jul 2020) rewrote Rao again: "Rao's argument
used the Shannon noiseless coding theorem. It turns out that the argument can be arranged in
the very slightly different language of Shannon entropy" — prefix codes and code-length
accounting become conditional entropy and the chain rule. His stated payoff is mechanical:
"One nice advantage of the entropy formalism over the combinatorial one is that the analogue
of this instance of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality automatically becomes an equality."

**(c)** Information theory into extremal set theory — twice, by two different routes.

**(d)** No search or formalisation of ALWZ. The *classical* Erdős–Rado lemma is formalised
in Isabelle/HOL (René Thiemann, Archive of Formal Proofs, Feb 2021).

**(e)** Thirteen months for the cascade against 59 years of near-stasis: Kostochka 1997 was
essentially the only significant improvement in 37 years, and Naslund–Sawin 2017 attacked
sunflower-*free* sets with the slice-rank polynomial method from the cap-set breakthrough —
an adjacent-field import that did *not* crack the conjecture. After ALWZ: Rao (Sep 2019) →
Tao (Jul 2020) → **Bell–Chueluecha–Warnke** (Sep 2020), whose (Cp log k)^k drops the log p
and is the current best. Sideways: **Frankston–Kahn–Narayanan–Park** (Oct 2019) repurposed
the spread machinery to prove the fractional Kahn–Kalai expectation-threshold conjecture,
and **Park–Pham** (2022) proved full Kahn–Kalai in five pages, the spread lemma falling out
as a corollary.

**(f) MOVE — re-derive a fresh proof in a cleaner category, then look sideways.** *Trigger:*
a new result whose argument is ad hoc or phrased in a formalism with slack (explicit
constructions, encodings, case analysis). *Action:* identify the formalism in which its key
inequality becomes an *identity*, and rewrite. Then extract the reusable lemma from the
middle and test it against unrelated open problems. *Check:* the rewrite must reproduce or
improve the bound, not merely restate it — and scoring should credit the extracted lemma,
since here the spread lemma outlived the application that produced it.

## 9. Greenfeld–Tao: a counterexample to the periodic tiling conjecture

**(a)** If a finite F ⊂ Zᵈ tiles Zᵈ by translations, must it tile periodically? Stated by
Lagarias–Wang (1996), implicit in Grünbaum–Shephard (1987). Known true for d=1 (Newman
1977), R¹, **Z²** (Bhattacharya 2020, by ergodic theory), R² for topological disks (Kenyon
1992), convex tiles in all d. arXiv:2211.15847; *Annals* 200 (2024) 301–363.

**(b)** Three chained encodings turning tiling into programming. (1) *One equation → a
system:* stack many tiling equations into one over a larger group, creating "a 'tiling
language', in which each sentence … expresses a different type of constraint." (2) *Tiling
language → functional equations:* the vertical line test — A ⊕ ({0}×H) = G×H says exactly
that A is a graph of a function — converts set constraints into function constraints.
(3) *Functional equations → a Sudoku puzzle:* target a non-periodic p-adically structured
function (last nonzero base-p digit) on a board where every non-vertical line must exhibit
2-adic behaviour. Their vocabulary — "expressible" and "weakly expressible" properties — is
explicitly analogous to Π⁰₀ and Σ⁰₁. Tao on programming with tiles: weakly expressible
properties "allow us to easily construct quite complicated weakly expressible properties out
of a 'library' of simple weakly expressible properties, much as a complex computer program
can be constructed out of simple library routines."

**(c)** Computability theory (the domino problem, Wang tiles, Berger 1966), model theory,
p-adic valuation arithmetic, commutative algebra (Frobenius in F_p[Zᵈ], powering the
dilation lemma). Ergodic theory and Fourier analysis were tried and **abandoned**: "Our
investigations also originally used ergodic-theoretic and Fourier-analytic techniques, but
we ultimately found combinatorial methods to be more effective."

**(d)** **Nothing was computed.** No search, no code, no formal verification. The group and
hence the dimension are "in principle explicitly computable, but we have not attempted to
optimize the size of these objects"; the blowup is exponential because one must conjunct
exponentially many expressible properties. The informal figure reported is ~2^(100^100).
Open Question 10.1 asks for the smallest d.

**(e)** 26–35 years, with **two published no-gos as navigation**. *Oct 2020, structure of
translational tilings:* a new combinatorial proof of Bhattacharya, plus the first crack — an
8-element F ⊂ Z² with a level-4 tiling that is not weakly periodic. *Aug 2021, undecidable
tilings with two tiles:* the decisive no-go, the "swapping property", proving matching
constraints **cannot** be encoded with a single Wang-style tile. Tao at the time: "we were
forced to introduce a second tile … This appears to be an inherent feature of the method,
since we found a partial rigidity result … that obstructs this encoding strategy." That is
what sent them to Sudoku. Then announcement (18 Sep 2022) and full paper (29 Nov 2022) —
during which the encoding itself changed, from p = 53 to a 2-group, because "we were not
able to make these two types of functions 'talk' to each other."

**(f) MOVE — build the counterexample as a machine.** *Trigger:* a conjecture asserting
every solution of an expressive constraint system is structured or periodic. *Action:*
establish that the constraint language encodes boolean logic plus a counter, assemble a
library of reusable encodable properties, then *program* an aperiodic object. *Check:*
verify the language is genuinely closed under the compositions you need — the failure mode
is two sub-languages that cannot talk to each other, which happened here and forced a
redesign. *Corollary — the important rule:* when an encoding attempt fails, try to prove a
**rigidity theorem** explaining why. "This encoding is impossible" tells you which encoding
to try next; an unexplained failure tells you nothing.

## 10. Tao–Ziegler and the inverse conjecture for the Gowers norms

**(a)** Green–Tao, *Linear equations in primes* (2006), established Hardy–Littlewood
asymptotics for systems of linear equations in the primes — but **conditionally**, on two
named conjectures: MN(s) (Möbius orthogonality to nilsequences) and GI(s) (the inverse
conjecture for Gowers norms: large U^{s+1} norm implies correlation with a step-s
nilsequence).

**(b)** The reframing is organisational: *isolate the obstructions as named standalone
conjectures, publish the main theorem conditionally, then discharge them one at a time*.
One intractable problem becomes a public dependency graph with an explicit critical path.
GI(s) was proved by Green–Tao–Ziegler, MN(s) by Green–Tao, at which point the 2006 theorem
became unconditional retroactively. A parallel strand extended the transference machine
itself rather than the primes: *The primes contain arbitrarily long polynomial
progressions* (Tao–Ziegler) replaced arithmetic with polynomial progressions, reusing the
majorant apparatus on a harder configuration.

**(c)** Ergodic theory — the Host–Kra/Ziegler structure theory of characteristic factors,
where nilsystems are the universal objects — imported into finitary additive combinatorics.
Ziegler's presence on both papers is the mechanism: the adjacent field arrived as a
collaborator. Also nilmanifold equidistribution (Lie theory). A low-characteristic
finite-field analogue was separate, since the naive form there is **false** and needed repair.

**(d)** No significant computation or formalisation.

**(e)** ~6 years from conditional statement to unconditional, across a chain of papers, with
the finite-field cases and low-characteristic correction as intermediate rungs.
**[UNVERIFIED — arXiv identifiers, dates and journal details in this entry come from memory
and were not confirmed against a live source.]**

**(f) MOVE — publish conditionally on named obstructions.** *Trigger:* a proof complete
except for one or more clearly statable gaps. *Action:* do not wait. Name each gap as a
standalone conjecture with a precise statement, publish the main theorem conditionally, and
treat the named conjectures as an explicit work queue. *Check:* each must be *self-contained*
— statable and attackable without the parent proof — or it restates the difficulty rather
than decomposing it. *Payoff:* the conditional theorem is citable at once, others can attack
the sub-conjectures, and discharging one upgrades every downstream result simultaneously.

## 11. The Equational Theories Project

**(a)** For magmas, take the finite list of equational laws of bounded complexity — **4694**
of them up to symmetry — and ask for every ordered pair whether one implies the other:
roughly **22 million** questions, essentially none of which anyone would pose alone.
Launched by Tao in **September 2024** as an open Lean-4-backed collaboration.

**(b)** The reframing is the choice of target. Instead of one hard question, take a
**complete, mechanically enumerable universe** of easy-to-state questions and resolve *all*
of them. This makes the work massively parallel, makes partial progress a percentage, lets
automation handle the bulk, and concentrates human attention on the residue. The interesting
mathematics is defined *after the fact* as whatever the machines could not close.

**(c)** Automated theorem provers and SMT solvers, finite model builders for
counterexamples, term-rewriting engines, custom high-performance search code, and Lean 4
with Blueprint as the integration and trust layer — the coordination stack proven out by
PFR a year earlier. **[UNVERIFIED: the specific tool roster.]**

**(d)** Verification is the point: every implication and refutation lands as checked Lean
rather than a claim. The overwhelming majority of pairs fell to automation; a small residue
required human insight and bespoke constructions. **[UNVERIFIED: exact resolved/unresolved
counts, contributor count, completion date, resulting paper identifier.]**

**(e)** Months, not years, for a problem with no prior literature — because it was
*constructed to be* attackable at scale. The relevant precedent is infrastructural, not
mathematical: PFR showed a Blueprint-plus-Lean repository lets strangers contribute verified
work without trust. **[UNVERIFIED: 2025 completion details.]** Related and also
**[UNVERIFIED]**: during 2025 Tao worked with AI systems on mathematical discovery (an
AlphaEvolve collaboration is reported) and engaged with the Erdős Problems database, where
problems were reportedly resolved or located in the literature with AI assistance; which
were genuinely *solved* versus *found already solved* was not verified.

**(f) MOVE — mechanise an exhaustive universe, then mine the residue.** *Trigger:* a class
of questions that is finitely enumerable, uniformly statable, and individually shallow.
*Action:* enumerate the class, throw every prover and model-builder at it, require
machine-checked output, and publish the frontier of unresolved cases as the live work queue.
*Check:* the residue is the deliverable — a search resolving 100% by machine found no
mathematics, and one resolving 10% chose the wrong class. Tune the complexity bound so
machines clear most of it and the remainder is human-sized. *Second check:* machine-checked
output is what permits contribution without review capacity.

## Move catalogue

The (f) rules deduplicated. This is the file's actual output.

**A. Weaken the target, deliberately and along a named axis.**
A1 quantifier: all → almost all (3). A2 conclusion: bounded → almost bounded, exact →
asymptotic (3, 5). A3 parameter range: all n → all large n, accepting ineffectivity (5).
A4 *hypothesis* instead of conclusion — find the averaged version your proof actually
consumes (2). A5 ambient problem: prove it for a perturbation that keeps every property
your method exploits (4). *Meta-rule:* before attacking T, enumerate its weakenings and
check which known barriers each escapes — Tao's 2011 Collatz no-go blocks the full
conjecture and not the almost-all version, and he wrote both.

**B. Change the measuring apparatus.**
B1 change the *measure* to one the dynamics preserves, so local results iterate (3).
B2 change the *ambient measure* so a sparse set becomes dense, then apply a density theorem
relatively (1). B3 change the *size functional* to one with a chain rule — entropy for
cardinality (6, 8).

**C. Import from an adjacent field, preferably as a person.**
C1 observed imports: ergodic theory → combinatorics (1, 10); information theory → additive
combinatorics and extremal set theory (2, 6, 8); probability and potential theory → complex
analysis (5); PDE invariant-measure methods → number theory (3); computer architecture and
computability → PDE and tiling (4, 9); numerical optimisation → analytic number theory (7);
contact geometry → fluids (4, downstream). C2 the reliable transport is *collaboration*, not
citation — Ziegler on the Gowers-norm papers, Fouvry–Kowalski–Michel–Nelson bringing trace
functions into Polymath8, Miranda's group taking the fluid computer into contact geometry.
C3 old discarded ideas are an adjacent field too: PFR ran on Gowers' entropy approach from
twenty years earlier. Search the abandoned-attempts literature, including collaborators' own.

**D. Prove the barrier.**
D1 when attempts fail, characterise what they share and construct an object satisfying that
characterisation for which the theorem is false (4). D2 when an encoding fails, prove a
rigidity theorem saying why — it names the next encoding to try (9). D3 score a no-go as
progress; it prunes, and here it navigated. D4 probe the boundary from the positive side
too — the 2009 log-supercritical result measured how far energy methods reach (4).

**E. Construct, don't just seek.**
E1 show the constraint language encodes boolean logic plus a counter, build a library of
reusable encodable properties, then program the counterexample (9). E2 verify closure under
composition first; disconnected sub-languages are the failure mode. E3 accept grotesque
parameters — the tiling dimension is unoptimised and enormous, and existence was the point.

**F. Decompose and publish partially.**
F1 name the gaps as standalone conjectures and publish conditionally; discharging one
upgrades everything downstream (10). F2 modularise into components with a published
interface so they improve in parallel (7). F3 expose numeric parameters and keep a live
leaderboard so gains compose (7). F4 **fund the orthogonal branch** — monotone improvement
on a fixed architecture has a ceiling, and a structurally different attack can leapfrog the
ladder from a weaker start. Polymath8's real lesson (7).

**G. Rewrite and mine other people's proofs.**
G1 find the formalism where the key inequality becomes an identity, and rewrite (8).
G2 extract the reusable lemma from the middle and test it on unrelated problems — the spread
lemma outlived its sunflower application (8). G3 expect a cascade: each rewrite exposes slack
for the next, four steps in thirteen months (8).

**H. Mechanise, and make the machine's output checkable.**
H1 enumerate an exhaustive universe of shallow questions, automate the bulk, treat the
residue as the deliverable (11). H2 machine-checked output removes trust as a prerequisite,
which is what lets strangers contribute (6, 11). H3 formalising a finished proof is
parallelisable at near-zero coordination cost — three weeks, ~25 strangers, 5% of the code
from the author (6). H4 computation settles *instances*, not conjectures: the 13 GB SAT
certificate resolved one value of C and did not generalise (2).

## Ladder statistics

| Result | Open | Tao's programme | Prior partials | Preceded by a no-go? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Green–Tao | ~68 yr | ~2 yr | 3 | No |
| Erdős discrepancy | ~83 yr | 5.5 yr | 3 | No |
| Collatz | ~82 yr | 8 yr | 5 | **Yes — his own** |
| Navier–Stokes barrier | 14 yr | 7 yr | 3 | Was itself the no-go |
| Sendov | 61 yr | ~1 yr | 8 | No |
| PFR | ~24 yr | ~5 mo | 2 | No |
| Prime gaps | ~100 yr | 13 mo | ~20 | Yes (GEH barrier at 6) |
| Sunflower | 59 yr | ~1 mo | 2 in 59 yr | No |
| Periodic tiling | 26–35 yr | ~2 yr | 2, both no-gos | **Yes — navigational** |
| Inverse Gowers | 4 yr conditional | ~6 yr | chain | No |
| Equational Theories | new | months | infrastructural | No |

Readings for an automated agent:

- **Median prior-partial count is 3.** Fewer than three established weaker statements means
  the frontier is early; twenty (prime gaps) means it is an optimisation problem — and there
  the winning move was to leave the ladder.
- **Two of eleven were preceded by an explicit no-go, and one *was* the no-go.** Both
  navigational cases had the barrier written by the same author who later went around it.
  Generate barriers on your own frontier, don't just read them.
- **Programme length is unrelated to problem age.** An 83-year-old problem took 5.5 years; a
  59-year-old one took a month of rewriting. Age predicts nothing; the *arrival of an
  external tool* (Matomäki–Radziwiłł, ALWZ) predicts a great deal.
- **Computation was decisive in exactly one case and decorative in most.** Where it mattered
  it was the endgame of an already-parameterised problem. Reaching for computation before
  the problem is parameterised is the error to avoid.
- **The two fastest results reused someone else's fresh output** — Tao's sunflower rewrite
  11 months after ALWZ, and PFR's revival of a 20-year-old idea. Monitoring adjacent output
  beats attacking a cold frontier.
