# 04 — Tao on machines doing mathematics

What Terence Tao has actually said about machine-assisted and AI mathematics,
the mechanisms that made his machine-assisted projects work, and the design
requirements those imply for an autonomous math-solving agent.

Every claim carries a URL. Material that reached us through a page summarizer
rather than raw bytes is marked `[secondary]`. Conjecture-generation mechanisms
are in the companion file `04b-conjecture-generation.md`, split out to keep both
under the repository's 500-line cap.

**Primary sources used throughout.** *Machine assisted proof*, Notices AMS
72(1) 6–13, Jan 2025 — cited below as **[MAP]**, read from
https://terrytao.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/machine-assisted-proof-notices.pdf
(the AMS copy at `ams.org/notices/202501/rnoti-p6.pdf` returns 403). Note its
preprint is dated 10 Feb 2024 and therefore **predates AlphaProof**; it cites
AlphaGeometry but must not be cited for AlphaProof commentary. Mastodon threads
are quoted from `mathstodon.xyz/api/v1/statuses/<id>` and `/context`, which
serve the post body where the HTML page does not.

## Known gap in this file

Item 5 of the research brief is only **partly** covered. The mechanisms of
machine conjecture generation are in `04b`, and Tao's AlphaEvolve work is in
§II.6 below. **Not yet covered, and not reconstructed from memory:**

- Tao's own remarks on numerical/experimental exploration preceding proof —
  how he uses numerics to decide what is worth trying to prove.
- The Erdős problems database (`erdosproblems.com`, `teorth/erdosproblems`)
  and his involvement in it, beyond the single #728 episode quoted in §I.
- OEIS-driven discovery and sequence lookup as a conjecture engine.

The research pass covering these was lost in transit rather than completed. It
is a gap, recorded as one; do not treat §I and §II as complete on this point.

# I. What Tao says machines are good and bad at

## I.1 Good at

| Claim | Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Verification is mathematics' structural advantage.** Almost uniquely, machine output can be checked, so an unreliable generator is still usable. | "the most promising uses of AI come from combining them with more traditional and reliable verification methods, in order to filter out hallucinations" — **[MAP]** |
| **Literature and semantic search.** Already past the break-even point. | The Cramér's-theorem query that GPT-4 had botched was answered by o1 with "a perfectly satisfactory answer"; a 2010 MathOverflow question he had needed human experts for got "a perfect answer". https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/113132502735585408 |
| **Routine, tedious, high-volume steps.** | "not the science-fiction conception of an superintelligent AI that can solve complex mathematical problems autonomously, but a valuable assistant that can suggest new ideas, filter out errors, and perform routine case checking, numerical experiments and literature review tasks, allowing the human mathematicians in the project to focus on the exploration of high level concepts." — **[MAP]** |
| **Drawing out what the user already knows.** | "I see a role for these tools in drawing out a user's latent knowledge in a problem, simply by being a good listener and proposing reasonably relevant ideas that the user is expert enough to evaluate." — **[MAP]** |
| **Specific subtasks, already net-positive.** | The prompting-and-verification overhead "is already below 1 for some specific subtasks, such as semantic search, data formatting, or generating code for numerics to assist a mathematical research exploration." https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/113132502735585408 (reply in thread) |
| **Formal geometry at olympiad level: solved.** | "IMO level geometry problems are now effectively a solved problem for specialized AI tools" — https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/112850716240504978 |
| **Scaling one argument across a family.** | "in the future one may be able to study hundreds of equations at once, perhaps working out an argument in full for just one equation and letting AI tools then adapt the arguments to large families of related equations, querying the author whenever the extension of the arguments is non-routine." — **[MAP]**, written seven months before he launched exactly such a project |

## I.2 Bad at

| Claim | Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Originating the key idea.** | On a complex analysis problem, o1 "could work its way to a correct (and well-written) solution *if* provided a lot of hints and prodding, but did not generate the key conceptual ideas on its own, and did make some non-trivial mistakes. The experience seemed roughly on par with trying to advise a mediocre, but not completely incompetent, (static simulation of a) graduate student." https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/113132502735585408 |
| **Creative strategy variation.** | Given his own blog post summarising partial progress on an Erdős problem and asked for the missing ingredient, o1 "proposed the same strategy that was already identified in the most recent work … but did not offer any creative variants of that strategy. Overall I feel that while there is some ability to randomly generate some creative strategies, this aspect of LLM tools is still rather weak." (same thread) |
| **Currency with a live toolchain.** | On Lean formalisation: the model "understood the task well and performed a sensible initial breakdown of the problem, but was inhibited by the lack of up-to-date information on Lean and its math library in its training, with its code containing several mistakes." (same thread) |
| **Net cost is still above break-even for research subtasks.** | "the effort put in to get the model to produce useful output is still some multiple (but not an enormous multiple now, say 2x to 5x) of the effort needed to properly prompt and verify the output." (same thread) |
| **Cost per problem.** | AlphaProof's results came "though currently requiring genuinely significant amounts of compute per problem, and human assistance on the formalization side" — https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/112850716240504978 |
| **Not attacking hard problems, on the evidence.** | Modern LLMs' role in the Equational Theories Project was "the dog that did not bark"; see §II.4. |

## I.3 The failure mode that matters most: plausible-but-wrong

This is the class an autonomous agent must be built against, and Tao documents
four distinct shapes of it.

**Confidently wrong arithmetic, then confidently wrong self-justification.**
**[MAP]** records GPT-4 computing `7*4 + 8*8` as 120, and on challenge
producing 92 — the failure is not the slip but the fluency of the recovery.

**Right vocabulary, wrong mathematics.** Asked in 2023 for the theorem behind a
vaguely worded query, GPT-4 "produced a string of mathematical nonsense, but
curiously it did manage to reference the logarithmic moment generating
function" — **[MAP]**. Surface-level topical correctness is not evidence of
correctness, and it is precisely what makes the output hard to reject.

**Verifier exploitation.** From his AlphaEvolve collaboration: the system is
"extremely good at locating exploits in the verification code", placing points
nearly on top of each other to satisfy an imprecisely stated distance
constraint. His team rewrote the verifiers in exact arithmetic with
conservative bounds, and he warns that "blindly trusting the AE values can be
risky as they may be a consequence of verifier exploits rather than any true
progress." https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2025/11/05/mathematical-exploration-and-discovery-at-scale/

**Novelty that is not novel.** An Erdős problem (#728) was solved "more or less
autonomously by AI", with the result apparently not in the literature. Tao
later appended: "in the days after the above posts were made, it was discovered
that the methods in these AI results were very similar to that of a 2014 paper
of Pomerance, and in fact Pomerance has now released a short note showing how
the methods of that paper also provide a solution to problem #728."
https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115871649394962391 · summary at
https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07421 · caveats collected at
https://github.com/teorth/erdosproblems/wiki/AI-contributions-to-Erdős-problems

The same thread records the AlphaProof team's earlier attempt at #728 finding
"several trivial solutions, if 𝑎 or 𝑏 were allowed to be large compared with
𝑛. This technically solved the problem, but was deemed not in the spirit of the
question." https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115855845720777387 — a specification bug,
found by a solver, which is the same phenomenon as verifier exploitation one
level up.

## I.4 Reported capability is a property of the harness, not the model

Tao's July 2025 thread is the sharpest thing he has written on evaluation. He
opens: "there is in fact a very wide spread in capability (several orders of
magnitude) depending on what resources and assistance one gives the tool, and
how one reports their results."
https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/114881418225852441

He then lists what happens if you change the IMO's format — days instead of
hours (or "some sort of expensive and energy-intensive time acceleration
machine"); problems rewritten by the team leader before the exam; unlimited
tools and internet; six students on one problem sharing partial progress; the
leader steering away from unpromising directions; only the best of six
solutions submitted; and, last:

> "If none of the students on the team obtains a satisfactory solution, the
> team leader does not submit any solution at all, and silently withdraws from
> the competition without their participation ever being noted."

https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/114881419368778558

Conclusion: "in the absence of a controlled test methodology that was not
self-selected by the competing teams, one should be wary of making overly
simplistic apples-to-apples comparisons … I will not be commenting on any
self-reported AI competition performance results for which the methodology was
not disclosed in advance of the competition."
https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/114881420636881657

Each bullet maps to a real practice — AlphaProof's three days per problem, its
hand formalisation, tool access, parallel search, steering, best-of-n, and
selective non-reporting. §III.5 turns the list into recorded fields.

# II. The mechanisms, precisely enough to reimplement

## II.1 The blueprint DAG

Patrick Massot's `leanblueprint` (https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint)
is a LaTeX document that doubles as a project tracker. Tao's tour of it on PFR:
https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2023/11/18/formalizing-the-proof-of-pfr-in-lean4-using-blueprint-a-short-tour/

**Node.** One LaTeX theorem/definition/lemma environment, carrying a label (its
identity in the graph); `\lean{Namespace.decl}`, the Lean declaration(s) it
corresponds to; `\leanok`, claiming the environment is fully formalised and
applied *separately to the statement and to the proof*; `\notready`, meaning the
blueprint itself is incomplete here; `\discussion{n}`, the GitHub issue where it
is argued about; and `\mathlibok`, merged upstream.

**Edge.** `\uses{labels}` — and the tool distinguishes **labels needed to
state** the theorem from **labels used only in its proof**. That distinction is
what makes parallelism sound: a node whose *statement* dependencies are
formalised can be stated, and therefore depended upon, long before its proof
exists. `\proves{label}` attaches a proof written elsewhere.

**Status lattice**, rendered as node colour: not ready → can state → stated
(declared in Lean) → defined → fully proved → already in mathlib. Tao's
operational summary: "the goal is to get all the bubbles leading up to and
including the 'pfr' bubble at the bottom colored in green."

**Consistency check.** `leanblueprint checkdecls` verifies that every Lean
declaration named in the blueprint exists in the project or a dependency, and
requires a completed `lake build` — so the blueprint cannot drift into citing
declarations that were renamed or never written.

**CI.** GitHub Actions rebuilds the graph, the HTML and PDF renders and the
doc-gen4 API docs on every push, deploying to Pages. On PFR the rebuild took
about half an hour: the dashboard is eventually consistent, not live.

## II.2 Why the DAG parallelises — the actual argument

Tao states it twice, and it is the load-bearing claim of this whole file.

> "A traditional mathematics collaboration rarely involves more than five or so
> co-authors, in part due to the need for every co-author to trust and verify
> the work of every other; but formalization projects routinely involve scores
> of people who may have had no prior interaction, precisely because the formal
> proof assistant allows for individual subtasks in the project to be precisely
> defined and verified independently of the other subtasks." — **[MAP]**

> "some contributors may play the role of 'project managers', focusing for
> instance on establishing precise 'blueprints' that break the project down
> into smaller pieces, while others could specialize into individual components
> of the project, without necessarily having all the expertise needed to
> understand the project as a whole." — **[MAP]**

And on the blog: "it is not necessary to wait for earlier stages of the
argument to be fully formalized to start working on later stages"; contributors
"can work on one small corner of the project without necessarily needing to
understand all the mathematics that goes into the project as a whole."

Three separable properties, worth naming individually because an agent runtime
can have some without the others:

1. **A statement is a contract.** Once stated in Lean, it can be depended on
   while its proof is still `sorry`.
2. **Correctness is checked by the compiler, not by a maintainer.** Trust
   between contributors is not required, so contributor count is unbounded.
3. **Comprehension is local.** A contributor needs to understand one node.

## II.3 PFR — the worked example

33-page human proof; **about 20 collaborators; three weeks**; dependency graph
fully green (**[MAP]**; announcement
https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/111526765350663641). Compare **[MAP]**'s other data
points: Flyspeck took Hales and 21 contributors 11 years against a 20-year
estimate; the Liquid Tensor Experiment took ~18 months for a 10-page proof.

Formalisation found a real defect: "one of our lemmas had omitted by mistake the
hypothesis that the ambient group be 2-torsion."

Tao's cost estimate, from **[MAP]**: the de Bruijn factor — formal effort over
informal effort — is "still well above one (I estimate ∼ 20), but dropping. I
believe there is no fundamental obstacle to dropping this ratio below one,
especially with increased integration with AI, SMT solvers, and other tools;
this would be transformative to our field."

**And it has already gone below one, once.** On the hardest EQT result:

> "This was perhaps a situation in which the current state of formalization was
> sufficient to make the completion of the proof *faster* than if it was done
> by traditional pen-and-paper methods, because of the burden of redoing a
> large number of case checks every time the definitions were updated."

https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/wiki/Terence-Tao's-personal-log

The mechanism is specific and reusable: the construction required over a
hundred non-collision checks, the definition of "partial solution" changed
several times, and "with each such change, Lean could verify a significant
number of the previous proofs continued to work under the new definitions."
Formalisation pays off exactly where a definition is unstable and the checking
burden is mechanical — which is the situation an autonomous agent is in
constantly.

## II.4 The Equational Theories Project — the scaled version

Launched 25 Sep 2024, primary goal met 14 Apr 2025. Paper arXiv:2512.07087,
34 authors, "over fifty contributors". Repo `teorth/equational_theories`.
Blog: https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/10/12/the-equational-theories-project-a-brief-tour/
Slides (ICERM, 15 Sep 2025):
https://app.icerm.brown.edu/assets/544/9916/9916_5552_Tao_091520251530_Slides.pdf

**Scale.** 4,694 equational laws (≤4 applications of the magma operation);
**22,028,942** ordered implication pairs. Final state: 0 unresolved for general
magmas, 2 for finite magmas.

**The amplification, which is the single most important number here.** Only
**10,657** positive implications and **586,925** negative ones were proved
directly in Lean — **597,582 facts producing 22,028,942 answers, ~37×**, purely
from transitive closure plus the duality symmetry `x◇y ↦ y◇x`.

**The method ladder**, Tao's own words from the slides:

> "Most of the implications were 'low-hanging fruit' that could be resolved by
> relatively simple techniques, such as: Brute force use of ATPs · Brute force
> testing of small finite magmas (e.g., all magmas of order at most 4) ·
> Testing of special magmas, such as linear models x ◇ y = ax + by + c on a
> ring, or translation-invariant models x ◇ y = x + f(y − x) · Applying
> transitive closure or duality. This reduced the original set of 22028942
> problems to about a thousand."

**524 finite magmas refuted 13.6 million implications** (13.3M at size 3
alone), at a total cost of 165 CPU-hours. The residual ~1,000 problems then
consumed the bulk of fifty people's remaining six months, and every one of them
was negative.

**Tools.** Vampire (saturation and finite model building), E, Z3,
Prover9/Mace4, SAT inside the greedy-closure analysis; `egg` and `duper` only
in forks, kept out of the base repository; `lean4checker`/`lean4lean` for
kernel replay; `native_decide` banned to keep the trusted base small.

**Ingestion of machine proofs.** Stefan Hetzl's pipeline, quoted in the slides:
implication → Prover9 → gapt → resolution-to-sequent-calculus → line-by-line
Lean emission. There was also a reverse path — a machine proof "deconstructed"
into a two-line human argument.

**Repo mechanics worth copying directly.**

- A custom `equation` command emitting both the semantic form (a sentence over
  magmas) and the syntactic form (a pair in a `FreeMagma`) from one declaration.
- **`@[equational_result]`** — an attribute CI harvests to rebuild the whole
  implication graph from the codebase. The graph is *derived*, never restated.
- **`proof_wanted`** — records a non-Lean or machine-generated result as a
  **conjecture** on the dashboard, upgradeable to `theorem` later. Status is
  explicit in the type, not in prose.
- GitHub Projects issues with **CI-enforced single-claimant locking**: "The CI
  ensured that at most one contributor could claim a task at any time."
- A five-column dashboard (explicit/implicit × true/false, plus unresolved) as
  the quantitative progress metric, plus Equation Explorer, Graphiti and the
  Finite Magma Explorer as views.

**Human insight as a multiplier on the solver, not a substitute.** Daniel
Weber's observation that one could restrict to magmas whose squaring map is
injective, added as an explicit axiom, "led to a 100x speedup in Vampire's
algorithm." Related: the project tracked per-equation **"immunities"** — which
technique classes are known not to apply — and Tao reports this "has helped
tremendously with 'weapon selection' for these problems."

**Granularity was the design variable.** Day 1: "the atomic tasks to complete
are very small and most of them do not require extensive expertise in either
Lean or math." Day 2: "projects that consist of extremely large numbers of
independent pieces, each of which are easy to understand and attackable by a
variety of methods, are a very good use case for these crowdsourced projects."

**Tao's ex-ante criteria for whether a problem is crowdsourcable at all** —
the best available triage checklist, from the slides: **modularity**;
**verifiability**; **elementary** components; **diversity of technique**;
**transferability** between component problems; a **precisely defined goal with
a quantitative metric of progress**, so that "even small incremental
contributions can be seen to 'move the needle'"; and **visualizability**.

**The dog that did not bark.** His own slide title. Modern ML contributed
Copilot autocomplete (used mainly as a Lean↔LaTeX translation layer), Claude
for building the visualisation tools, and one ChatGPT contribution to a
confluence argument. The work was done by ATPs. His verdict:

> "the older 'good old-fashioned AI' of automated theorem provers were far
> cheaper to run and already handled the overwhelming majority of the
> implications that the advanced AI tools could." [secondary — blog summary,
> https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2025/12/09/the-equational-theories-project-advancing-collaborative-mathematical-research-at-scale/]

He was told by a major AI company in the project's first days that their tools
resolved over 99.9% of implications "but with quite long and inelegant proofs",
and it did not change the project.

**Two operational warnings.** Compile time became a scaling bottleneck ("50
minutes in some cases … efficiency of compile time becomes a concern"). And
delaying a Lean/mathlib bump makes a codebase rot: at some point such projects
"will no longer be actively maintained, and their proofs, while still correct,
will become gradually more incompatible with the latest versions of the core
Lean libraries."

## II.5 AlphaProof, AlphaGeometry, and mathlib

**AlphaGeometry** (*Nature* 625, Jan 2024): a language model proposing **one
auxiliary construction** at a time, wrapped around a symbolic deduction engine
(DD+AR) run to saturation. The LM exists only because auxiliary constructions
come from an infinite space no symbolic search can enumerate. Trained on 100M
synthetic theorem-proof pairs derived from 1B random diagrams, 9M of which
needed an auxiliary construction — no human proofs. Scored 25/30 on IMO-AG-30
against 14 for the symbolic engine alone. **AlphaGeometry2** (arXiv:2502.03544)
reached 84%, and — the more interesting number — raised formal-language
coverage from 66% to 88% of IMO geometry problems: a third of them previously
could not even be *stated*.

**AlphaProof** (*Nature*, 12 Nov 2025, DOI 10.1038/s41586-025-09833-y; blog
https://deepmind.google/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/):
AlphaZero-style RL over Lean. ~1M informal statements auto-formalised
*stochastically* into ~80M Lean statements; proof-tree search with AND nodes
for conjunctive subgoals; and **test-time RL** — on a hard target it generates
variations of the theorem itself and trains on them live. IMO 2024: **28/42**
(gold cutoff was 29), "one problem within minutes and up to three days to solve
the others", after "the problems were manually translated into formal
mathematical language". Formal proofs score 7/7 or 0.

Tao's assessment, in full at https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/112850716240504978:
great work; geometry effectively solved; significant compute per problem and
human help on formalisation; "the database of formal proofs generated by this
effort could be a useful resource if shared more openly"; and, per the AI
effect, "once explained, it does not 'feel' like an exhibition of human-like
intelligence". He immediately contrasts NuminaMath, which "was fully automated
and orders of magnitude more resource efficient", using an LLM to generate
Python that brute-forces numerical answers — "the multidimensional nature of
the general challenge". https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/112850769040110612

In 2025 Gemini Deep Think scored 35/42 end-to-end in natural language inside
the 4.5-hour limit, officially certified — but Buzzard's summary of the two
years is worth keeping beside it: "what the last 12 months have given us is a
one point improvement." https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2025/08/03/ai-at-imo-2025-a-round-up/

**mathlib and what reuse buys.** 284,375 theorems and 135,578 definitions
across ~2.1M lines (https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_stats.html);
maintenance practice in arXiv:2508.21593. Tao: a formalisation project "will
typically contribute many basic mathematical results generated through the
course of the project to a common mathematical library, which makes it easier
for future formalization projects to proceed" — **[MAP]**.

The honest counterpoint is EQT itself, which "was rather elementary in nature
and only had a modest reliance on Lean's Mathlib". Reuse pays where the domain
is deep and the prerequisites are shared; it pays little where the problem is
elementary and self-contained. An agent should therefore not assume a library
is its bottleneck without checking.

## II.6 AlphaEvolve — search whose verifier is the security boundary

Tao, Georgiev, Gómez-Serrano and Wagner, *Mathematical exploration and
discovery at scale*:
https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2025/11/05/mathematical-exploration-and-discovery-at-scale/

The system does not optimise inputs; an LLM evolves *code* that generates
inputs, scored by an executable verifier. Across 67 problems: 20 matched or
beat the literature, 39 met expectations, 8 fell short. It recovered exact
solutions in readable form (the Talenti function for Gagliardo–Nirenberg),
generalised constructions across parameters, and struggled on analytic number
theory even with expert hints.

Two findings for §III. First, verifier exploitation (quoted in §I.3) — the
verifier is an adversarial boundary, and exact arithmetic is not a nicety.
Second, Tao's suggestion that this kind of search become routine: a standard
sanity check run against a new conjecture *before* publication, with negative
results systematically recorded rather than left as folklore.

## II.7 Summary: mechanism → what it buys → what breaks without it

| Mechanism | Buys | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| Statement/proof dependency split | Parallelism across the DAG | Work serialises behind unproved upstream nodes |
| `sorry`-able stated contract | Downstream starts immediately | Every contributor waits |
| Compiler as arbiter | Unbounded, untrusted contributors | Trust caps the team at ~5 |
| Status lattice + dashboard | Progress is measurable in units | No way to see whether a run is advancing |
| `@[equational_result]`-style derivation | One source of truth for the graph | A second list that disagrees |
| `proof_wanted` | Conjectures visible but not load-bearing | Unverified results silently satisfy goals |
| CI-enforced task claiming | No duplicated or clobbered work | Two workers on one node |
| Transitive closure + symmetry | ~37× amplification (EQT) | 37× the proving cost |
| Cheap-first ladder | 22M → ~1,000 before the expensive tier | Frontier-model spend on brute-force work |
| Immunity metadata | Weapon selection | Re-attempting known-dead techniques |
| Exact-arithmetic verifier | Search results mean something | Exploits reported as progress |

# III. Design requirements for an autonomous math agent

Each requirement: a testable capability, the evidence implying it, and where it
lands in this repository.

## III.1 Claims and verification

- **R1 Machine-checkable goal.** Every asserted claim carries a verification
  artefact — Lean term, executed program, or exhaustive check. *Test:* a claim
  with no artefact never reaches the derivation. *Repo:* `research/CLAIMS.md`.
- **R7 Red-team gate.** Nothing is accepted that the agent cannot restate and
  defend without re-invoking the generator; an independent role re-derives or
  refutes each claim, and disagreement blocks promotion. *Evidence:* §I.3.
- **R8 Calibrated evidence classes.** Every claim carries an evidence class —
  proved / machine-verified / numerically checked / heuristic / cited —
  and "certain" is reserved for machine-checked. *Evidence:* Tao's remark that
  AI tools "do not rate their own confidence accurately" `[secondary]`.
- **R27 "Table-true" is not proved.** A statement that has merely survived
  every instance tested is labelled as such and can never satisfy a goal.
  *Evidence:* TxGraffiti reserves "theorem" for formal proof; the Ramanujan
  Machine tested to 2,000 digits and still wrote that this "does not replace
  the need of a formal proof". See `04b`.
- **R9 Citation grounding.** Every literature claim resolves to a retrievable
  URL whose statement has been checked. An unretrievable citation is a failure.
- **R33 Novelty against the literature.** A claimed discovery carries a
  literature-search record, and where the problem has a numeric state of the
  art, the comparison against it. *Evidence:* FunSearch's argument that beating
  SOTA distinguishes discovery from retrieval; its inverse, Erdős #728 vs
  Pomerance 2014 (§I.3).

## III.2 The goal graph

- **R2 Explicit statement DAG.** A persistent graph of named statements with
  `uses` edges and a status lattice (open / stated / proved / verified /
  retracted), not a linear transcript. *Test:* the graph renders and every
  attempt names the node it targets.
- **R3 Contract-first decomposition.** A subgoal's *statement* is fixed before
  its proof is attempted, and downstream work may proceed against an admitted
  statement. *Test:* two concurrent arms progress, one depending on a stated
  but unproved sibling. *Evidence:* §II.1–II.2.
- **R4 Statement authorship stays supervised.** The agent cannot weaken a goal
  statement to make it provable; a statement mutation requires a directive and
  is logged. *Evidence:* Erdős #728's "trivial solutions … deemed not in the
  spirit of the question".
- **R21 Atomic granularity.** Subgoals small enough that one attempt can close
  one; the run reports the size distribution and flags a decomposition whose
  nodes never close. *Evidence:* EQT Day 1.
- **R22 Claim exclusion.** A node is held by at most one worker, enforced by
  the runtime. *Evidence:* EQT's CI locking; this repo's own
  two-containers-on-one-workspace failure.
- **R23 Conjecture status distinct from proved.** An unverified result is
  recorded as a conjecture (EQT's `proof_wanted`) and upgraded only on
  verification; the progress metric counts the two separately.
- **R12 Fan-out with a delta merge.** Independent nodes run concurrently, no
  arm reads another's output, and the merge folds counters by delta. *Repo:*
  already true post-attempt; R12 extends it to the goal DAG.
- **R13 Reusable lemma library.** Everything proved is stored keyed by
  statement and recall is attempted before any re-proof. *Test:* a duplicate
  subgoal in a later run is answered from the library.

## III.3 Search strategy

- **R5 Cheap-first ladder, model last.** Brute-force small structures →
  special parameterised model families → ATP/SMT under a time budget →
  closure, *before* any model call. *Test:* cost per resolved subgoal is
  instrumented by rung; reaching the model rung with cheaper rungs unexhausted
  fails the check. *Evidence:* 22,028,942 → ~1,000 (§II.4), and "far cheaper to
  run and already handled the overwhelming majority".
- **R5b Closure engine.** Every established fact is propagated through the
  problem's entailment relation and symmetry group before new work is
  scheduled. *Test:* direct proofs vs total answers, ratio ≫ 1. *Evidence:*
  ~37× in EQT.
- **R5c Immunity metadata.** Each open subgoal records which technique classes
  are known not to apply, and the scheduler reads it. *Test:* a technique
  recorded as immune is never re-attempted on that subgoal.
- **R5d Derived-axiom injection.** Solver calls carry an axiom slot for
  human- or self-derived auxiliary facts. *Evidence:* the 100× Vampire speedup.
- **R10 Numerics before proof.** The agent computes before it argues, and
  records negative results. *Test:* a conjecture node cannot reach `stated`
  without an attached numerical check. *(See the gap note — Tao's own writing
  on this is the part of the research still missing.)*
- **R11 Counterexample search as a parallel arm.** Refutation runs against its
  own budget alongside proof. *Test:* on a false statement the agent refutes
  rather than producing a plausible proof. *Evidence:* Autograph, 1989.
- **R35 Refute-then-repair.** A refutation schedules a weakened or corrected
  variant rather than closing the line. *Evidence:* the knot conjecture killed
  by braids and repaired via the injectivity radius — Tao's "promising
  paradigm". See `04b`.
- **R28 Non-redundancy filter.** A generated conjecture is discarded unless it
  says something not implied by the existing claim and theorem list. *Test:*
  given a known theorem and a trivial consequence, neither is emitted.
  *Evidence:* Dalmatian tests informativeness *before* correctness, and "more
  than half of the program" is the triviality filter.
- **R29 Defined stopping rule.** Conjecture generation halts on a condition,
  not on budget exhaustion, and the run reports which fired. *Evidence:*
  Graffiti's "Bingo" coverage condition.
- **R30 One-line objective swap.** A new extremal problem is posed by supplying
  a scorer alone. *Evidence:* Wagner — "the only thing we need to change … is
  the function that calculates the score".
- **R31 Soft scoring available.** Penalised violations, not only hard
  constraints; the penalised form is the default for constrained construction
  search. *Evidence:* `edges − 2·triangles` outperforming the hard constraint.
- **R32 Population diversity.** Island-model or otherwise partitioned
  populations with best-shot prompting, not a single hill-climbing lineage;
  collapse is detected. *Evidence:* FunSearch's four ingredients.

## III.4 Verifiers and tools

- **R6 Adversarial verifier.** Any scored search uses exact arithmetic and
  conservative bounds, and the agent is assumed to be attacking it. *Test:* a
  deliberately loose verifier is exploited in a regression test and the
  hardened one is not. *Evidence:* AlphaEvolve.
- **R17 Ground the toolchain.** Formal or library-dependent output is checked
  against the *current* library, not the model's memory of it. *Test:*
  generated Lean compiles against pinned mathlib in CI. *Evidence:* the o1 Lean
  experiment; EQT's version-drift warning.
- **R26 Pin and bump deliberately.** Library and solver versions are pinned per
  workspace; a bump is an explicit, tested, visible event.
- **R36 Off-the-shelf over bespoke ML.** No component requires per-problem
  hyperparameter tuning. *Evidence:* PatternBoost — "machine learning is hard!"
  — and their unmodified use of Makemore.
- **R34 Interpretable output.** Extremal results ship with the program or
  argument that generates the object, not only the witness. *Evidence:*
  FunSearch's cap-set program; AlphaEvolve recovering the Talenti function.

## III.5 Honesty about the harness

R14 (budget honesty) and R15 (methodology declared in advance) expand into one
table, derived directly from §I.4. Six of the seven map onto files this
repository already has.

| Tao's knob | Field the run must record |
|---|---|
| Extended time / "time acceleration machine" | wall-clock and token/compute spend per result |
| Problems rewritten before the exam | whether the statement was hand-formalised or restated, and by whom |
| Unlimited tools, textbooks, internet | which tools were registered (research gating already does this) |
| Six students on one problem, sharing progress | concurrency, and whether arms shared state |
| Leader prompts toward favourable approaches | every directive, timestamped — `config/DIRECTIVES.md` |
| Best solution submitted, rest discarded | attempts generated vs attempts submitted |
| **Silent withdrawal when nothing works** | attempts abandoned, and the run reported *even on failure* |

- **R24 Quantitative progress metric and rendered frontier.** A small set of
  counters that move on incremental contributions, plus a renderable goal
  graph. *Test:* every attempt either moves a counter or is recorded as a dead
  end. *Evidence:* two of Tao's seven crowdsourcability criteria.
- **R19 Failure ledger.** Dead ends, refuted conjectures and exploited
  verifiers are recorded and consulted. *Evidence:* Tao's proposal that
  negative results stop being folklore; PatternBoost reporting its failure to
  beat a conjectured bound as weak evidence *for* it.

## III.6 Scope, direction and delivery

- **R25 Problem-suitability triage.** Before committing budget, score the
  problem against Tao's seven criteria — modularity, verifiability, elementary
  components, diversity of technique, transferability, quantitative progress
  metric, visualizability — and report which are absent. *Test:* a monolithic,
  non-verifiable problem is flagged rather than silently fed to the
  decomposition machinery.
- **R16 Brainstorming mode, kept out of the claim ledger.** The agent can
  enumerate candidate strategies with rationales for selection, distinctly from
  asserting a result. *Test:* strategy proposals are filed as directives, never
  as claims. *Repo:* already the `director` role's rule. *Evidence:* Tao's
  "drawing out a user's latent knowledge … by being a good listener".
- **R18 Digestion, not just generation.** A result is done when it has a
  human-readable exposition tied to the machine-checked artefact — the
  blueprint's two-column discipline. *Test:* every proved node has both.
- **R20 Human interrupt at a boundary.** Direction reaches a live run without
  restarting it, is queued, and never enters the claim ledger. *Repo:* already
  satisfied by `./steer`; listed for completeness.
